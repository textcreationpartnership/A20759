            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               </gap>ebbe after this high tide, and a darke night of sorrow and mourning, after this bright sunshine day of gladnesse and reioycing. And that the rather, because by our sinnes long agoe wee haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued to bee dispoiled of Gods long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fauours, and with vnresistable violence doe pull and hale his iust iudgements vpon our guilty heads. For to say nothing of the despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate wickednesse of prophane men, who being rotten members of this body of our Church and Countrey, doe deserue to be cut off (which is not commonly effected without the griefe and smart of all those sounder parts which are neere about them) who doth not see that the best seruants and dearest children of God, are by long ease growne so slothfull and secure, and so corrupted with continuall peace and prosperitie; that they need to bee quickened and rouzed vp with Gods scourges of correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to bee purged from their drosse and rust by the fiery triall? And therefore it will not bee amisse, if in this summer and sunshine of our prosperity, wee erect shelters to shade vs against the stormy tempests of approching
<pb facs="tcp:10735:3"/> troubles; and in the daies of our peace, doe prepare our selues for this spirituall warfare, building fortresses and bulwarks for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence before wee bee assaulted by the enemie, and putting on our spirituall armour, before our great Commander doe summon vs to the fight, and cause the alarme to be sounded to the battell. For then shall wee most securely inioy our peace, when as we stand vpon our guard, and haue our weapons in readinesse to resist the enemy; and then shall our ioy of prosperity bee most sweet and delightfull, when it is not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered with the feare of losing it, nor with the expectation of those afflictions, whose force and fury wee are by due preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on enabled to ouercome. Yea though the body of our state had a sound constitution, and did not onely for the present inioy the health of flourishing prosperitie, but were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so assured that it would continue for the time to come: yet are there many members of it, which being diseased with the sores of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doe need to haue the plaisters of comfort applied vnto them. And though the whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of our Church militant do not yet ioyne
<pb facs="tcp:10735:4"/> in a maine battell with these spirituall enemies, yet are there many of Gods souldiers picked out by our Lord and Generall, to skirmish in their courses with them, who need to be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in this spirituall warfare, and to be so trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the skill of this fight, that when they are assaulted, they may manfully stand vnto it and obtaine the victory. In which respects, I ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the future benefit of the whole body, and the present good of euery particular member, haue vndertaken this paines in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them for this fight. In which my ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uors, if God so blesse mee, that I attaine vnto my end I shall haue no small ioy, seeing I shall communicate with them in all their consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and triumph together in their victorious conquest. Or if I faile hereof, yet shall I not lose all my labour, seeing whilest I prouided these cordials of comfort for the curing of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I my selfe haue been cheered by them in my wants and weakenesse; and whilest I cooked others meat, haue somewhat staied my fainting stomack by licking mine own fingers, &amp; tasting of these meats, as they passed thorow my hands.</p>
            <p>Now these my labours I humbly offer to
<pb facs="tcp:10735:4"/> your Graces patronage, as an vnfained testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of that loue and duty which your worth and merit doe iustly challenge. For if the Elder that doth gouerne well, bee worthy of double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, especially if hee labour painfully in the word and doctrine; how much are wee bound to shew by all meanes, with what zeale wee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour you, who by your gouernement (as chiefe Liuetenant vnder our dread Soueraign) preserue among vs the purity of our christian religion, from being tained and corrupted by errours and heresies (herein extending your care not only vnto vs, but also to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Churches round about vs) and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue with increase the peace of our Church, defending vs all you may, from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roades and inuasions of our Romish enemies: and also (as though you were quite freed from the waight of this burthen) doe continually imploy your selfe in sound doctrine, and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full preaching; not only vrging those, who are vnder your gouernment to take like fruitfull paines, by your graue authority, fatherly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, and earnest exhortations; but also shaming those who neglect it, by your exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb facs="tcp:10735:5"/> seeing they come farre short of you, in that which they haue only to intend, who are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise taken vp in such multitude of busines. The which I write not to get vnto my self the base re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of a seruile flatterer, (for who yet could e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer challenge me of such self-respecting flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) but that God may bee glorified in those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellēt gifts wherewith he hath inriched you; and that they being continued vpon this record for after ages, you may not only be acknowledged a worthy President &amp; Gouernour vnto vs, but be imitated as a praecedent &amp; pattern vnto those who shall come after you; and so leaue behind you such a sweet sent of a good name, as it were of a pretious ointment, that those who yet breathe not, may be refreshed by it.</p>
            <p>The Lord long continue, increase and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply these his good gifts and graces in you, that hee more and more may haue the glory of them, his Church &amp; children the vse &amp; benefit, &amp; your self both the present comfort of a good conscience, and the greater measure of glory &amp; happinesse at the day of Christs appearing.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:10735:20"/> fought vnto blood. For no sooner are Sathan and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells beaten backe, and that huge army of his hellish tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions discomfited and ouercome with the word of God, and the assistance of his holy spirit; but gathering againe their scattered forces, and adioyning vnto them their strong aids the world and the flesh, with these fresh supplies they set forward againe with such hope and courage, as though they had neuer receiued any ouerthrow, and (as it were) filled with shame and malice because of their former foyle, they redouble their force and affresh assault vs with greater furie. The consideration whereof as it should moue all Christians to shake off securitie, and to stand vpon their guard with all care and watchfulnesse, armed at all points with their spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall armour, that so they may be ready for the encounter; so should it moue all Gods faithful Ministers, who are made Captaines and Leaders vnder our great commander; to traine vp Gods people and souldiers vnder their charge in that skill which is required in this spirituall Warfare, and teach them so to vse their weapons, that they may bee the better inabled to defend themselues and offend the enemy. In conscience of which duty I (the weakest and vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of many,) haue vndertaken this hard taske, and hauing laid open the malice, might, and politicke stratagems of our arch enemie the Diuell, and instructed the weake Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an (according to my mediocrity of skill) in the art of this Christian Warfare, and taught him how to prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for the day of conflict, and so to buckle vnto him the christian armour, and manage his spirituall weapons, that he may be assured to foyle his enemy and obtaine the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; no sooner had I ended this labour, but I presently disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered new forces led vnder the conduct of the world, one of Sathans chiefest commanders and strongest ayds, armed with no lesse power and malice to worke the Christians o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow, that so they may againe be made the captiues of sinne, and regained to the seruice of their olde master, the Prince of darkenesse, and god of this world. And beeing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:10735:20"/> hartened and encouraged by that late victory obtained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that chiefe enemy of our saluation, and resting assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by that experience which I haue had of the inuincible strength of my great Lord and commander assisting mee in this fight, of the goodnes of the spirituall armour, and of the excellency of that both defending and wounding sword of Gods word, that if now againe I gaue the assault, I should also obtaine the victory; I willingly reentred the field with a purpose to encounter these new supplies: and first taking a view of the enemie, that I might discouer their strength, number, and militarie discipline, I perceiued that they so far excelled in might, multitude, and warlike pollicie, that they were an army plainely inuincible in respect of humane strength. In the front and maine battell were marshalled the worlds glorious and glittering troups of prosperity, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with those often approued weapons of honours, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and riches, wherwith few are encountred who are not also ouercome. And obseruing the manner of their fight, I found it to bee no lesse admirable then dangerous, for they ouercame by yeelding, wounded by perswading, killed by imbracing, and whilest casting away their armes and all signes of hostility, they offered themselues as captiues and slaues, they became conquerours of those who tooke them, iaylors of those that kept them, and commanders of those who seemed to hold them in captiuity. In the flanke and rereward were ranged those terrible troups of aduersity and affliction, there placed by the Diuell and the world, to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish those by force, violence, and furious encounter, who could not be ouercome by the perswading allurements of deceiptfull prosperity, and these enemies seemed to bee of hideous strength, and in respect of their sterne and grimme visage, proud threats, and dangerous weapons, fearefull to looke vpon.</p>

                     </note> assault, teaching the Christian souldier, who wil ioyne with mee in this fight, to ouercome them by contemning thē, &amp; to stand with impregnable strength against their tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous furie, &amp; smooth smiling malice, by turning his eies from their alluring baits, by refusing their false fauours, by stopping his eares against their charming perswasions, and by suspecting most their malitious attempts, when as with greatest shew of loue they smile and fawne vpon him. And thus hauing enabled him, by the assistance of Gods spirit, and his owne carefull endeuour to beate backe the force of these enemies also, and to put them to flight: it now remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that being armed with Gods might, &amp; defended with the Christian armour, especially with the shield of faith, and sword of the spirit, we doe encounter those other sort of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; not doubting (beeing thus assisted) but wee shall also giue them the foyle, and so obtaine full victory against these worldly forces. For howsoeuer this enemy aduersitie, and those innumerable troups of afflictions, are in shew much more terrible then prosperity, and those glorious for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces led vnder his cōduct, yet are they much weaker in truth, and lesse dangerous when wee come to buckle with them. For these indeed are grim in their outward visage and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, but not so fearefull, when hauing experience of their strength, they are become more familiar with vs; like those Barbarians which, when they were to fight with their enemies, painted themselues that they might appeare more terrible, whereas in truth they were weake and naked, vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to endure the first onset: For so these afflictions haue in them but a painted shadow of fiercenesse, and doe put on but an vglie visard to make them full of terrour at their first appearing, whereas if the visard be done away, and we cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to look vpon them through the false glasse of feare and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:10735:21"/> astonishment, doe behold them with a true iudgement, wee shal find them so tolerable and easie to be endured, through the assistance of Gods spirit, that there will bee no cause of terrour and amazement. But on the other side those ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, prosperity, and worldly allurements, hiding hostility vnder pretense of friendship, and beeing much stronger, and more forcible then they seeme in outward appearance, doe bring vs into a pernitious securitie, and without shew of assault get the victorie. Afflictions like billes and pikes make a terrible shew when they cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

They like the fiery serpents sting vs, but with sense of paine, make vs seeke for remedy, looking vp to the true brasen serpent, that we may be cured; these like the viper putting vs to no paine, bring vs into a sweet slumber of securitie, which endeth in that dead sleepe of death and condemnation. They wound with paine and enforce vs with torment to seeke recouery, these with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, making vs to loue still the weapons that hurt vs, and to abhorre the meanes whereby we may be healed, because euen our wounds &amp; sores are pleasing vnto vs. The one like the winde boysterously blowing vpon vs, make vs more carefull to hold fast the garment of Gods graces that they be not taken from vs; the other like the Sunne warming vs with delight, cause vs of our owne accord to cast it from vs. Finally they vanquishing vs by force make vs captiues vnto sinne, who are willing vpon the next opportunity to come out of thraldome and regaine our liberty, because wee find but hard entertainment; these making conquest not onely of our strength and power, but also of our hearts, wills and affections, retaine vs in a voluntary seruitude, for the wages of worldly vanities, so as we haue no desire to come out of this pleasing bondage, nor to recouer our liberty though the meanes were offered vs. In all which and many other respects <hi>Salomon</hi> truely saith, that, <hi>It is better to goe into the</hi>

And therefore let vs in the next place fit our selues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the day of conflict, &amp; as we haue learned to contemne the world when it fawneth, so also let vs learne not to feare it when it frowneth and rageth; that so when our great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander soundeth the alarme vnto battell, wee may with comfort and courage enter the field, and becomming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, may receiue the crowne of victory, glory matchles and happines endlesse. And to this purpose let vs consider of the nature, quality and strength of these our enemies; and then of the meanes whereby wee may be inabled to endure their encounters, abate their strength and furie and so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the victory. Concerning the former wee are to know that afflictions diuersly considered may bee diuersly descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; for if wee looke vpon them as they are in their owne nature, &amp; by God inflicted vpon the wicked; they are those euills of punishment, wherewith he beginneth iustly to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish their sinnes euen in this life, and as it were the flashes of hell fire, and first entrance into vtter destruction; as it may heereby appeare in that they are all comprized vnder the curse of the law, and denounced and threatned against the transgressours of it. Againe if we consider them as inflicted by God vpon the faithfull, they are those fatherly chastize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wherewith out of his loue and wisedome hee eyther correcteth them for their sinnes, that being brought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance they may not be condemned with the world; or<note place="margin">1.

So that howsoeuer the afflictions of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and of the faithful are all one in respect of their matter, yet they differ in respect of the author, the one beeing the punishments of an angry and iust iudge, the other the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements and trialls of a gratious and louing father; and in respect of their vse and end, the one tending to destroy, the other to saue; the one to punish, the other to correct; the one to begin the torments of hell, the other to fit and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for the ioyes of heauen.

For whereas there is one affliction truely so in it owne nature layde vpon men, there are many which they fancie to themselues out of meere conceipt, the which wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting strength to hurt them because they haue no true exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they make powerfull enough to deiect their minds by the strength of their apprehension. Thus one torments him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with greefe, because he hath lost those riches, which if hee had still possessed hee would neuer haue vsed; another vexeth himselfe about the smoake of honour, eating out his heart with sorrow because hee is put from that authoritie which whil'st hee had it, oppressed him with the burthen; &amp; pining with griefe because his superiour eyther frowned vpon or graced him not; because hee is bearded by his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualls, and not according to expectation respected and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced by his inferiours, and because he hath not the wall and precedence, or higher place of those, before whom his

Thus a bare feare of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted euils which neuer happen, doth as much vexe men, as those which they truly suffer, and a bare suspition of faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines in their friends as much tormenteth them, as if they were truely guilty.

One is most tender when his honour is tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched; another little respecteth this, but groweth very passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate if he be wronged in his riches, this man is patient in bearing blowes, but cannot indure contumelious wordes; but another is sensible onely of smart, and careth not for the winde of words, so he may sleepe in a whole skinne. Yea by reason of this opinion, crosses are made comforts, and great blessings in themselues are turned into great afflictions, in conceipt: and heereof it is, that that which is one mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, is anothers torment, and that which one affecteth as his paradise another loatheth as his hell. One thinketh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint of his liberty to be an intolerable bondage, though he fare daintelie, lie soft, and abound in all plenty: another would willingly presse into such a prison, and could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to become an immured Anachoret to haue such case with such abundance. One taketh his chiefe contentment in ease and idlenesse, and to another it is the greatest paines to sit still and doe nothing, seeing all his delight is in businesse and imployment: and accordingly as he is afflicted and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the least labour, so this man is no lesse mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted and greeued, if for want of imployment hee be forced to wast his time in languishing idlenes. Finallie if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider afflictions in respect of the world inflicting them vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the faithfull, they are those tentations on the left hand, grounded on all those miseries which are incident to the life of man, whether in respect of his mind, body, name, state or friends, whereby the world as the instrument of Sathan
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:10735:23"/> endeauoureth to discourage and hinder them in the way of godlinesse and righteousnesse which leadeth to Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and to diuert and thrust them into the way of sinne which leadeth to destruction. By all which it appeareth what we vnderstand by afflictions, namely all euills of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment sent of God, eyther as from a father to correct vs, or as a iudge to punish vs; al things which crosse our desires, and do molest and greeue vs, either in their owne nature, or through our opinion and conceipt; and finally all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series of this life which the diuell and the world doe cast in our way, as we are running in the race of godlinesse for the garland of eternall happines, that like briars they may hold vs from going forward, or like thornes vnder our feete may vexe and torment vs, that so being weary in this vnpleasant passage, we may turne aside into that broad and delightfull way of sinne which leadeth to destruction.</p>
                  <p>And thus our afflictions are but bare punishments only,<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 4. That afflictions are eyther bare punishments or else also ioyned with sinne.</hi>
                     </note> or else ioyned with sinne: Bare punishments I call all those plagues, crosses, losses, troubles and trialls which by God are inflicted vpon men; and that either vpon the wicked for the satisfying of his iustice which is offended, in regard of whom they are properly called punishments as tending to their hurt and destruction; or vpon the faithfull for their chastisement or triall, in respect of whom they are impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and in a large signification called punishments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not inflicted to satisfie Gods iustice which is<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 32.</note> fully satisfied by Christ, but out of fatherly loue for their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, that they may not bee condemned with the world. Punishment ioyned with sinne is, when as God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth one sinne with another, not by infusing into men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny corruption or malitiousnesse, for seeing hee is most holy and pure, and his will the rule of all iustice, hee cannot bee said to be the author of sin, nor to haue any hand in that euil which his nature abhorreth, and his iustice punisheth, but when for their former sinnes he leaueth them to their owne corruptions, lusts, vile affections, and to a reprobate minde,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10735:24"/> as the Apostle speaketh, Rom. 1. 24. 26. 28. and beeing so<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 24. 26. 28.</note> left to themselues they run headlong into wickednes: for that men may become as bad as <hi>Cain, Saul▪ Ahab,</hi> or <hi>Iudas,</hi> it needeth not that externall wickednesse should be infused into them, seeing it is enough if they be left of God to their owne naturall corruption which inclineth them to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of sin; euen as for the descending of a stone, it is not needfull to cast it to the earth, but onely to leaue holding of it, and then it will fall downe in it owne nature; and as the boat goes vp the streame by an externall strength thrusting it on, but needeth not any to carrie it downe, seeing it dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth that way of it owne accord; so wee goe against the streame of our naturall corruptions towards the hauen of rest by the assistance of the diuine power which helpeth vs forward; but we need not to be thrust downward, seeing it is sufficient if the Lord withhold his hand &amp; leaue vs to our owne naturall inclination. Againe the Lord punisheth in men one sin with another, when like a righteous iudge hee doth punish their former sins by deliuering them into the power of his executioner Sathan, to bee tempted and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by him; suffering them to bee ruled by him, because they haue pulled their necks from the yoke of his subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to row in his gallies, because they would not freelie serue their great King &amp; maister. Neither is the Lord heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made the author of sin, seeing he onely performeth a iust act of a righteous iudge, in deliuering vp wicked men for their demerits to Sathan, as his executioner to be blinded, misled, and punished by him; nor yet are they any whit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused, in that being deliuered vp of God they run headlong into all sinne; because they haue deseruedly brought vpon themselues this feareful iudgement, by their former sinnes, and now are ready to commit all wickednesse, not by any outward violence forcing them thereunto, but by Sathans perswasion alluring them, and their owne sinfull lusts incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them to perpetrate these sins with all chearfulnes and delight, hauing therein no respect vnto God or his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:10735:24"/> but onely to please and satisfie their owne corrupt will and carnall lusts. So that God punisheth one sin with another, not by infusing wickednes, or by tempting, that is, alluring and prouoking men vnto sin; for thus <hi>God temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth no man,</hi> as the Apostle affirmeth: but by withdrawing<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 13.</note> his grace, and by leauing men to bee misled by their owne corruptions. Hee leadeth men into tentation, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them into euill; not by perswading or compelling them to commit wickednes, for his nature abhorreth it, and his will is the rule of all iustice, but by giuing them ouer, and deliuering them vp, as a righteous iudge, vnto the diuell his executioner, to be for their former sins further blinded, hard<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned &amp; made more wicked, that their condemnation might bee more iust and fearefull in the life to come. And of this we haue manifold examples in the Scriptures, for thus the Lord hardned <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, when he denied to giue him<note place="margin">Exod. 7. 3. 11. &amp; 9. 12.</note> the oyle of his grace whereby it might bee softned, and left him to his owne obstinacie, and Sathans tentations. Thus he punished the spirituall whoredome of the Israelites, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them vp to commit corporall vncleannes. <hi>Hos.</hi> 4. Thus<note place="margin">Hos. 4. 13. 14.

And thus God punished the pride, presumption, and selfe confidency of <hi>Peter</hi> by suffring Satan to sift him like wheat, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile thus farre against him, as to moue him first to deny, and then to forsweare his master.</p>

Of the efficient and impulsiue cause of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
                  </note> wee will consider of their causes, effects, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects and adiuncts or qualities, that so their nature beeing better vnderstood, there may bee a fitter passage to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course following. And first wee are to know that the Lord himselfe is the chiefe efficient and principall cause of all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, which are not sinnes; for so himselfe speaketh by his Prophet; <hi>Shall there be euill in a city</hi> (that is the euill of<note place="margin">Amos. 3. 6.</note> punishment and chastisement) <hi>and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> not that it is Gods proper and ordinary worke to afflict his creatures; for being the cheefe goodnes, hee chiefely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth doing good, hee delighteth in the conuersion of<note place="margin">Michah. 7. 18.</note> sinners, and in shewing mercy; and thus doing hee doth his owne proper and vsuall worke, familiar to his owne nature; whereas the other is his worke improperly, and as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet calleth it <hi>his strange worke, and his strange act,</hi> which with a kind of necessity we force vpon his iustice, by our sin<note place="margin">Esay. 28. 21.</note> and wickednes, so that the meritorious cause of afflictions is sinne, whereby men offend against Gods iustice in transgre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssing his Law, as shall more fully appeare heereafter; &amp; that whether we respect the wicked or the faithfull; although there bee great difference in the end why God afflicteth them; for (as I haue said) these punishments are laide vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wicked for sinne, that they may satisfie Gods iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice by taking due vengeance on them: but howsoeuer they are also inflicted vpon the faithfull for sinne, yet not to the former end, but that they may bee brought vnto the sight and sense of it, that they may repent of it, and for the time to come forsake it, that so they
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10735:26"/> may not bee condemned with the world. The impulsiue or motiue cause, wherby the Lord is incited to inflict these pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments and afflictions, is his iustice which is heereby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested; for if euen in this life God punisheth the sins of the wicked, where they are to receiue all their good, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> speaketh to <hi>Diues,</hi> then how much more grieuous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments<note place="margin">Luc. 16. 25.</note> remaine for them in the life to come, which is the time appointed for their torment? And if he punish &amp; cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise the sinnes of his faithfull children, where shall the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and the vngodly appeare? as the Apostle speaketh. If he<note place="margin">1. Pet. 4. 17.</note> will not suffer them to escape without seuere correction, whose sins are punished in Christ euen by his death as being satisfactorie, and in themselues by repentance, as being the fruit of their faith, loue and zeale, which cause them <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zach. 12. 10.</note>
                  <hi>and lament for him whom they haue pearced,</hi> and to afflict their soules with bitter sorrow, for that they haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him who hath so loued them; then how certainely will there be a day of iudgement, wherein God wil manifest the seuerity of his iustice, in punishing their outragious sins, which haue w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> an high hand sinned against him, seeing they haue not had their punishments here, but haue passed their time in all worldly prosperity, pleasure and delight? Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the mercy of God moueth him also to inflict on the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full these afflictions, that it may be manifested to his glory and their comfort, whilest hereby he stoppeth them in their course of sinne, and draweth them neerer to himselfe when they goe astray, that so escaping condemnation, they may walke in that way of holinesse, which will bring them to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall happinesse. The instrumentall causes of these punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and afflictions are the whole army of Gods cretures, which as they are his ready instruments, in deriuing his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings and benefits to those that feare and serue him; so are they no lesse ready with all chearfulnesse, to inflict those pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, which his iustice hath pronounced against the wicked for their confusion and destruction; and those affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions wherewith hee correcteth the slips and faults of his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:10735:26"/> owne seruants, that they may be brought to repentance and amendment. But especially this Lord of hosts imployeth in this seruice his Angells; and that both the good Angels, who are ministring spirits, alwaies prest to doe his will, as appeareth in the destruction of the hoast of Senache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib. and in the seuentie thousand Israelites slaine by the Angell of God with the sword of pestilence; and also the euill and wicked spirits; as appeareth in the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Iob,</hi> and in the deceiuing and ouerthrowing of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab,</hi> in the tormenting of <hi>Saul,</hi> in the afflicting of the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> and in the tempting of our Sauiour Christ himselfe. And for this purpose he no lesse vsually imployeth the world, that is, worldly wicked men, sometime to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his iudgements one vpon another, and sometimes as his rods and whips, wherwith he correcteth the faults of his owne children and seruants: and that either, when by their allurements, perswasions and euill example; or threats, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and persecution they draw them into sinne; or when after they haue committed it, they serue as instruments to correct and chastise those offences, which through their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements the faithfull haue fallen into. As wee may see in the example of the Israelites thus afflicted with the Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, Moabites, Philistims, Aramits and Babilonians. All which (if we looke to their owne intentions) had no purpose at all to be Gods instruments for the correcting of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; but chiefly aimed at their destruction, being moued thereunto with enuy, rage, hatred, couetousnes, and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous desire of soueraignty; but if we respect the will &amp; worke of God, they were so ruled by his power and prouidence, that they were but his bare instruments for the chastising of his seruants for their amendment.</p>

The subiect of these afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (if we respect the place) is this miserable world; for this is the valley of death, the vale of teares, the fiery furnace, in which when we haue beene tried and approued, wee shall be laid vp in Gods treasury of blessednes; the lists of our spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all combat, in which when we haue fought and ouercome, we shall afterwards triumph in glory and be crowned with victory; the race, wherein hauing run we get the price and garland of blessednes; the vineyard, in which we labour till the night of death, when as we shall receiue the wages of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting happines; and finally the place of our pilgrimage, which when we haue trauailed, we shal ioyfully arriue at our owne country, and enter into the paradise of our delights.

For in themselues they are the ground and foundation of a strong tentation; namely that because wee are thus afflicted, it is a certaine signe that wee are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God as wicked and reprobate men, and for our sins iustly cast out of his loue and fauour; that we are pursued by his wrath, which beginneth to inflict those deserued punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vpon vs in this life, wherewith we shall be ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the life to come; and therefore that our estate is most
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:10735:30"/> miserable and desperate, our burthen for the present beeing intolerable, and wee without hope of ease for the time to come; if at least God hauing forsaken vs, we doe not helpe our selues with our owne power &amp; policie, and those means sayling which Gods word warranteth as lawfull, we do not finde some other meanes of our owne deuising, whereby we may bee eased and deliuered. The scope of which tentation is to ouerthrow our faith, hope, and affiance in God, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our chiefe enemy, who doth thus afflict vs; to plunge vs into deepe despaire and to driue vs into al impatiencie, that thereby we may be moued to murmure and repine against the Diuine prouidence, and euen to blaspheme God to his face; to cast off all profession of religion, al feare &amp; seruice of God as being bootlesse &amp; vnprofitable, and finallie to cease relying vpon his power and promises, and to vse all wicked and vnlawfull meanes for the remouall of these afflictions.</p>

For Sathan is ready to tell vs that these affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are the iust punishments of our sinnes, and the signes of Gods wrath, and heauy displeasure; that they are testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to assure vs that wee are cast out of his loue and fauour; for if God loued and delighted in vs, he would communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his blessings vnto vs, which are the pledges of his loue, and not continually torment vs with these plagues and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, afflictions of mind and body, sicknesses and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, imprisonment and banishment, losse of goods and friends, and innumerable other miseries, which in his law he hath threatned against the wicked and reprobate. And thus he vrged this tentation against our Sauiour Christ himselfe, vsing his pouerty &amp; want of necessaries, as a reason to proue that he was not the Sonne of God.

And this <hi>Iob</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth<note place="margin">Iob. 12. 5.</note> (where he saith that hee who is ready to fall, is, as a spent lampe despised in the opinion of the rich.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:10735:32"/> which they sustaine; for though they can be content to stoop and humble themselues vnder the hand of God, and quietlie beare the burthen which he layeth vpon them; yet their sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks rise, and their hearts are ready to boyle with anger, and impatiencie, when men, who should rather pitty them, doe deride and scorne, contemne and insult ouer them in their distresse. But especially the strength of this tentation is increased, when as the afflictions of the faithfull are thus aggrauated, not onely by strangers from whom they expect no better, but also by their friends &amp; acquaintance, by their kindred and allies, who are bound vnto them not onely in nature and neerenesse of blood, but also by many benefits bestowed, and manie good offices performed vnto them. For this made Iobs afflictions greeuous and intolerable, when vnto them were added the vniust criminations and hard censures of his friends, from whom he expected com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, whereas their mercy and compassion towards him would haue made his heauy burthen light, like a load carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon many shoulders.

                  </note> of afflictions, partly as the meanes of inflicting them, and partly as it doth aggrauate and increase them beeing infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: so the corrupt flesh is as ready to admit and entertaine this tentation; and iudging all things according to sense and present apprehension, as in the time of prosperity it swelleth with pride and presumption, perswading men that none more then they are in Gods loue and fauour, because they haue had the largest draught of temporall benefits allowed vnto them; so in the time of aduersitie and affliction, it is as basely deiected and plunged into the bottomlesse gulfe of horror and despaire, perswading men that they are forsaken of God, and pursued with his wrath, which now beginneth to take vengeance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. From whence proceedeth their murmuring
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:10735:33"/> and repining against God and his prouidence; their impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to beare that crosse from which they haue no hope to be eased; and their resolution to vse all vnlawfull meanes to vnburthen themselues, when lawfull meanes fayle and will not helpe. So that this tentation of afflictions beeing so strongly vrged by the Diuell and the world, and so readily intertained by our corrupt flesh, must needs be very potent and powerfull to preuaile against those who are assaulted with it; and that not only meere worldlings, who esteeming the worlds prosperity as their cheefe paradise, doe abhorre affliction as their greatest hell; but euen Gods faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, who nourishing this traitor (the flesh) in their bosoms are betraied by it, and so often foyled in this combat of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. Of the former we haue manifold examples among worldly wicked men, who being pressed with the waight of afflictions, seeke to ease their stomacks, by belching out their blasphemies against God; and feeling present smart, and hauing no hope of beeing eased for the time to come, fall into such impaciencie, that some languish in melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; discontent, refusing those comforts which they might enioy, because they are depriued of some which they desire; and becomming in all things miserable through their owne wilfull choice, because in some things they are miserable through necessity. Others tyred with the burthen of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons grow weary of their liues, and by laying violent hands vpon themselues, shorten their daies wilfully, leaping into the endlesse torments of hell, to auoid the temporary mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this world. Finally others wanting strength and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to beare their afflictions, and also this courage and desperate resolution to put an end vnto them by such a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent course, doe willingly fall into any manner of sinne, and practise all vnlawfull meanes, which seeme to promise vnto them the least hope of ease and freedome. Of the other wee haue an example in the Israelites, who though they were the sole people of God, deliuered by his mighty power from their malitious enemies, and enriched with many blessings
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:10735:33"/> (as it were) from the immediate hand of God, yet beeing a little afflicted and pinched with want, doe murmure and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine against the Lord, their creator and redeemer, being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued heereunto, sometime through a bare and false feare of not preuailing <note n="a" place="margin">Num. 14. 2.</note> against their enemies, and sometime for want of such <note n="b" place="margin">Exod. 16. 3.</note> meat as they lusted after, and of <note n="c" place="margin">Num. 20. 3.</note> water to quench their thirst. Yea euen <hi>Iob</hi> himselfe renowned for patience, beeing fore pressed with the waight of afflictions, doth often breake out into great impatiency, vttering such words as were not farre from blasphemy, if they had proceeded from a setled iudgement, and not from a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and distempered passion. For he curseth his natiuity, and wisheth that he had neuer bene, or that hee had miscarried in the birth; he complaineth that God was his enemy, and that he did shoot at him his enuenomed arrrowes, that hee oppressed him by strong hand, without hearing his cause, and that his terrours did fight against him. Thus also <hi>Dauid</hi> by his afflictions was brought somtimes to the brink of despaire, and sometime to bewray his impaciency; for he cryeth out that he was forsaken of God, that hee heard not his prayers, nor regarded his roaring, that Gods mercies were cleane gone, and his promises vtterly failed; that he had reiected his soule and pressed him downe with his terrours<note place="margin">Psalm. 22. 1. 77. 7. 88. 14. 77. 2. 12. 13.</note> and indignation; that the state of the wicked was happy, and that he had washed his hands in innocency in vaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was punished and chastened euery morning. And the like or greater impatiency was shewed by the Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> who also curseth the day of his birth, and the man,<note place="margin">Ier. 20. 14. 15.</note> that brought first newes hereof to his father, and wisheth that his mothers belly had bene his graue, or her wombe a perpetuall conception, because he came forth of it to see la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and sorrow, and that his daies should bee consumed with shame.</p>

And therefore, as on the one side wee are not in such a cowardly manner to feare these mighty enemies, nor dispayring of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to cast away our weapons, and betake our selues to flight: so on the other side, wee are not securely to contemne them, as beeing easie to ouercome; for if they haue foyled Gods greatest worthies and most valiant captaines; how shall not we be indangered, yea vanquished by them, if we were left vnto our owne strength, who are but vnexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed weakelings and common souldiers? But seeing the strength of our enemies, and our owne weakenesse, we must bee moued heereby by a liuely faith, to rest vpon the power of Gods might assisting vs, to implore his helpe and succour in this spirituall conflict; and then in the next place, to vse all the good meanes appointed by God, for the defending of our selues, and the obtaining of victory. Of which (as order requireth) I am now to speake; for as in worldly wars, it is requisite and necessary that we first know the nature, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, disposition and strength of our enemies, and then accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to thinke of the meanes, whereby we may be inabled to make resistance and obtaine the victory; so must wee doe in this spirituall warfare; and therefore hauing already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated of the former point, I come now to the other; in spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king whereof my purpose is (by the assistance of God) to

The which also is a fruit of our faith and affiance in God, for when we beleeue all his gracious promises made vnto vs, for the supplying of our wants, protection from perils, and deliuerance from those e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils which wee sustaine and suffer, and doe relye vpon them with assured confidence; then doe wee also wait Gods lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure▪ attend his pleasure, and hopefully expect when these promises shall be performed, and made good vnto vs for our vse and benefit. And this the Apostle teacheth vs, where he saith, that <hi>Faith is the ground of things hoped for; and the eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>

Now as this hope is the daughter of faith and affiance, so it is the nurse of patience, whereby it is fed and nourished, and so strengthened and vpheld, that it cannot faint or fall. So the Apostle telleth vs, that we are saued by hope which expecteth things inuisible,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 24. 25.</note> and if <hi>we hope for that we see not, we doe with patience abide for it.</hi> And thus doth our hope strengthen our patience, as it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth the performance of Gods promises, eyther respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this life or the life to come.

And thus doth the mariner whilest the storme lasteth, take excessiue paines to saue his ship and life, in hope that it will be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blowne, when as againe hee shall haue faire weather and a good passage; thus doth the poore man patiently indure his toylsome labour, whilest he hopeth that his paines wil bring riches, and his riches rest; thus doth hee who is tormented with a feauer, beare with patience his present greefe, whilest he hopeth for the end of his fit, &amp; the recouery of his health; and thus doth the poore traueller patiently hold out in his weary iourny, whilest he hopeth for sweet repose at his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys<note place="margin">

So that if wee loue the Lord, nothing wil be hard vnto vs which he enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vs, his will and pleasure will be the rule of our content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and whatsoeuer commeth from him for the triall of our loue and obedience, we wil take it well at his hands, and beare it not onely with patience, but euen with gladnesse and reioycing, seeing wee haue fit occasion to approoue our loue vnto him by these trialls. Againe our loue to God is a notable meanes to worke and increase in vs patience in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, because our loue toward him assureth vs of his loue towards vs, seeing our loue is but some small reflection of that heauenly heat, and but a little sparke of that infinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine flame; neither doe we beginne with him, but wee loue him, because he loueth vs first, as the Apostle speaketh. Now<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4. 10. 19.</note> whosoeuer is thus assured of the loue of God towards him, he may also with patience beare those crosses which come from him, seing they are not the punishments of a iust iudge, but the chastisements of a louing Father, in which hee ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not at his hurt and destruction, but at the bettering of his estate, and the euerlasting saluation of his soule. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore this loue worketh patience by giuing vs hope and assurance of our deliuerance, seeing heereby we know, that God taketh no delight in the torments of those that loue him. And therefore when he hath effected his owne good worke in vs, and hath recouered our spirituall health by these bitter and vnpleasant medicines, hee will minister them no more vnto vs, but as he can, because his power ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer faileth him, so hee will, because his loue neuer faileth vs, deliuer vs in most conuenient time out of all our troubles, and in the meane while will be present with vs, and so sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port

Concerning the first, the Lord giueth vs a generall rule for the expounding of all his threatnings, that they are alwaies to be vnderstood vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the condition of impenitency, and our perseuerance in sinne; namely that if we goe forward in our wickednes, and will not be reclaimed by these threats, then the iudgements threatned shall surely bee inflicted; but if wee forsake our sinne, and turne vnto the Lord by vnfained repentance, then this obligation of threatning, binding vs to satisfie Gods iustice by suffering punishment, is made voide and cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. So also the same rule is giuen for the expounding of Gods promises, namely, that if wee continue to feare and serue him, they shall bee made good vnto vs; but if like wandering Planets, we retrograde in the wayes of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and slide back into our former course of wickednesse, then also this bond assuring vs of Gods blessings, is made frustrate and of no vertue vnto vs, because the condition thereof is not obserued.

And finally, if we do not by vnfained repētance take vpon our selues an holy reuenge, that God may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified; Gods anger wil wax hot, and he wil glorifie his owne name by manifesting his iustice in our confusion.

For as the Lord is <hi>slow to anger,</hi> so when<note place="margin">Psal. 103. 8. 9.

                  <hi>vs.</hi> For if we haue truely repented vs of our sinnes, then are we assured by Gods infallible truth, that they are pardoned and quite blotted out of his remembrance; that we are now reconciled vnto him, and of enemies, are become seruants and children; that now there is not onely peace betweene vs, but euen loue and amity. And that therefore the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we beare, are not the fruites of enimitie and wrath for our destruction, but trials, whereby our gracious father prooueth and approueth our loue &amp; obedience; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our captaine and great commander trieth our valour, our skill in the Christian warfare, and the goodnesse of those spirituall weapons and armour, wherewith he hath fitted vs against the day of battell. From which assurance of peace and amitie with God, ariseth peace of conscience, which doth exceedingly comfort and stregthen vs in al afflictions, pouertie and imprisonment, greefes and sicknesses; yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the agonie of death it selfe, as our Sauiour implyeth in that speach to the sick of the palsie; <hi>Son be of good comfort,</hi>

                  </note> is a good conscience, by which the hart is defended against the assaults of affliction; so that though the outward parts, as it were the vtmost sconces and sorts, be battered and beaten downe with crosses and calamities, yet so long as this bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke remaineth sound and strong, it will so defend the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of the heart, that it will neuer bee surprized and sacked, nor be cowardly yeelded vp vnto our spirituall enemies. And this good cōscience the Apostle requireth in those who wil professe the faith of Christ, &amp; suffer for their profession; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (as he addeth) <hi>it is better if the will of God bee so: that we suffer for wel doing then for euill doing.</hi> Now y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we may obtaine this, there is required not onely that we labour to keepe our<note place="margin">1.

But if through frailtie and infirmity, we haue defiled our consciences with the filth of sin and wickednes, then in the next place we must labour to purge and cleanse them, washing out these spots &amp; staines with the pretious bloud of Christ applyed by faith, and by the teares of vnfained repentance, issuing from the fountaine of a contrite heart; for by faith our sins are not imputed vnto vs▪ and by repentance (as I haue said) they are so done away, and quite blotted out of Gods remembrance, as if they had neuer beene committed by vs. And this is the meanes to get and preserue a good conscience, which when we haue attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto, it will serue as a brazen wall against all the assaults<note place="margin">Ʋacare culpain calamitatibus maximum est solatium. Crātor apud Plutarch. de consol ad A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonium. Chrysost. ad pop. Antioch.

But as a spark or fiery cole falling into wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is presently extinguished: so the heat and excesse of all sorrow and greefe is cooled and quenched, when it befalleth him, who hath a good conscience. And therfore if we would haue patience in the time of trouble and affliction, let vs keepe our consciences cleare and vnspotted from sinne, and adorne our selues with all grace and godlines, for other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and patience are inseparable companions; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies accompany the one the other; &amp; therfore the Apostle linketh them together; <hi>Ioyne</hi> (saith he) <hi>vertue with your faith and with vertue knowledge, and with knowledge temperance, and</hi>

And thus doth <hi>Ezechias</hi> comfort himselfe and strengthen his faith, hope, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by calling to minde his integrity of heart in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice; <hi>I beseech thee O Lord</hi> (saith he) <hi>remember now, how I haue walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect hart, and haue</hi>

To this purpose one saith, that among all tribulations and humane griefes, there is none greater then a conscience burthened with sinne; for if a man be not wounded in conscience, but
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:10735:47"/> whole and sound within; when hee suffereth any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affliction, hee willl flye thither, and there hee will finde his God; but if there bee no peace there, because God will not bee where iniquity aboundeth, what shall a man then doe, and whether shall hee flye when hee suffereth tribulation, seeing whethersoeuer hee goeth, this enemy will pursue and torment him? In which respect hee compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the same place an euil conscience to a peece of wood rotten at the heart, which thought it may make a faire shew on the outside whilest it is vntouched and vntryed, yet if it bee put into the building, it indureth not when it beareth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waight; or if it be touched with the axe or wedge, it easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flyeth into fitters, and discouereth it inward rottennesse, whereas a good conscience which maketh outwardly no great shew nor flourish, is like a peece of timber, which though it be rotten on the outside in the sappie parts, yet is sound at the heart, and appeareth better the more it is tried, and strongly beareth the greatest waight that lyeth vpon it. Let this therefore be our care, that hauing our conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces cleare we doe not suffer as euill doers, but let vs eyther retaine our innocency whilest wee haue it, or regayne it, when we haue lost it, by true repentance; for a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence bringeth comfort, and comfort patience in afflictions; whereas there can be no consolation▪ where there is guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of ill deseruing, and without comfort nothing but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiency, shame and horror of minde, as the Apostle imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, where he exhorteth that none of the faithful <hi>suffer as a murtherer, or as a theefe, or an euill doer, or as a busie body in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

The like also may be said of our concupiscence and desires, which if they bee not moderated according to the necessitie of nature. but left at libertie to their owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate lusting▪ after superfluities and things vnnecessary, they will set vs on the racke of discontent, when they are

And thus hee who setteth his minde too much vpon worldly delights, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteth his tender and effeminate heart, when he susteineth the lightest crosse; yea if either his pleasures faile him alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or continueth not in that manner, measure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, which he inordinatly fancieth and desireth. Thus also must we in the tyme of our prosperity, exercise our selues in moderating and mortifying of our vnbridled and rash an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; for if a man be froward and cholericke, when hee is in all his desires soothed and pleased, what is to bee expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted but that he will be starke madde with fury, when he is crossed and thwarted? If hee be peeuish and fretfull when hee is made prosperities wanton, and the worlds darling; what patience is to be looked for, when he lyes groning vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the crosse, forsaken of his friends, and scorned by his enemies? So we must labour to mortifie discontent, and in all things to submit our wills to Gods good pleasure. For he who out of melancholick wantonnesse is discontented with plentie; how can he with patience indure want and penury? He who is not well pleased in the fruition of those great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites of health and strength▪ pleasure and liberty; how vnfauourie and ill relishing will sicknesse and weaknesse, paine and imprisonment, be to his dayntie pallate? He who cannot be contented, when hee enioyeth all that hee can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most wish and desire; how impatient is he like to shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, when hee hath plenty of nothing but wants and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uances, and how sensible will he be of smart and miserie? So likewise wee must subdue our pride, haughtinesse of spirit, and the (fruit therof swelling) emulation, wherby men study
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:10735:51"/> and labour to match their superiours, and excell their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals. For pride is the very nurse of impatiency, making men to fret and rage, murmure and repine, when they suffer those things, which in their proud conceit they thinke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of them; to grinde their teeth with disdaine, when they are forced to stoope vnder the crosse; and to gaule their necks, whilest they are constrained to beare the yoke of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, more with their impatiencie and strugling, then with the waight of the burthen which lyeth vpon them. So also it maketh the shame of their aduersitie more intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then the smart; and whilest they could with some pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence beare their miseries, if they were onely miserable to themselues, they are altogether impatient, because they are knowne to beare them. So also emulation in prosperity doth much aggrauate mens sorrowes in the tyme of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Finally we must labour in our prosperitie, to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and keepe vnder those contrary passions of sorrow and ioy; for hee who will weepe, when (as it were) hee but looketh vpon the whippe, will howle and cry out when he feeleth it; he who will mourne when he hath no cause, will be madde with griefe, when the waight of affliction lyeth heauy vpon him. And so hee, who immoderatly reioyceth in his prosperity commonly immoderatly sorroweth in the tyme of aduersitie; he who exsulteth with ioy, because the world smyleth on him, is vsually as much deiected with griefe when it lowreth and frown<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And the like may be truely said of all worldly things, which in their absence or presence become the matter and occasion of the most afflictions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the value and estimation which opinion setteth<note place="margin">Non tam rerum natura, quam patientium di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spofitio magna vel parua videri facit incumb en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia nobis mala.

And so vehemently doth this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion fasten vpon vs these imaginary afflictions, that they become much more intolerable, and we more impatient in bearing them, then those which haue their being &amp; waight from their owne nature and true existence; yea and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are more hardly remoued, and they comforted, who haue cast themselues vnder them, then in other calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; because the roote of the disease is internall through the errour of our iudgment, and so oftentimes wilfull and of choyce, rather then imposed by any necessity and constraint,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:10735:52"/> which wee naturally auoyde. Neither is there any other meanes to cure this sicknesse, and to ease the minde of the burthen of this affliction, but to remoue or rectifie the cause, which is a false and ill grounded opinion, by spirituall wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and a sound iudgment, informed and instructed by the word of God; whereby our mindes being illightned, and the mists of errour dispelled, which are cast before the eyes of our vnderstanding, by either sense, passion or carnall reason, we shall be inabled to iudge of all things according to truth, and as they are in their owne nature, whether they are to be desired as good, or auoyded as euill; or betweene both, neither much to bee affected, or much to bee shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as being of a meane and indifferent quality. And so shal not imaginary afflictions afflict vs, neither shall wee make those crosses to vs, which are no crosses in themselues; nor those heauie and intolerable, which in their owne nature are light and easie.

For as it is the nature of opinion to put sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and shewes, for reall existences, so also it doth (as it were) bombase our afflictions, which are truely so called, and like spectacles makes small ones to seeme great, whilest it doth aggrauate them as though they were new, vnheard of, and neuer suffered of by any other, although in truth they are common and ordinary. And therefore if we would haue patience in the day of tryall, and indure the assaults of affliction with vndaunted courage, let vs pull of these false vizards, which opinion putting on, doth make them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to appeare more terrible, and let vs looke vpon their<note place="margin">Quid id tua re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fert, si nec car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem perstringit, nec ad animam penetrat.?

And as though they could not bee wretched enough with the sense of present crosses, they ingrosse all causes of griefe, and wilfully seaze vpon needlesse sorrowes; and besides the present afflictions which they suffer, they recall those which are past, making their remembrance to torment their hearts, when as long agoe they were freed from the sense of them; and presently apprehend those which are not yet so much as imminent, meeting them in the mid way by a fearfull expectation, as though they made too slow haste, and would not come soone enough of their owne accord, vnlesse they thus po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted towards them. And thus men vex themselues with feare and griefe, when they heare but vncertaine rumours of great calamities, as though already they were ouertaken by them, whereas it may bee they will neuer happen, or if they doe, yet not of a long tyme, or not so grieuous as those which by feare were presented to their conceit. Thus in tyme of pestilence many are as much afflicted with feare of infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as they whose houses are already visited with the euils which they suffer. Thus in time of warre men as much tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment themselues with feare of sacking, spoyling and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, though oftentymes they escape all these dangers, as if
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:10735:53"/> already these miseries did lye vpon and ouerwhelme them. And finally, thus many when they can not comprehend fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture meanes of maintayning their estate, within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of their owne prouidence, vex themselues more with care and griefe for feare of pouerty, though now they enioy sufficient plenty, then there is iust cause they should, when they are pinched with want and penury. In which respect men indued with reason, are through their abuse of it, worse then the brutish creatures, for whereas by benefit of their reason, they might foresee euils, that they might either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent them, or arme themselues with patience to beare those which are vnauoydable, they abuse their light of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to foresee euils to come, that by a fearfull appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension they may ly groning vnder them, as if they were present; yea to surmize and prognosticate those miseries to themselues that neuer befall them; and to amplifie and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauate them before they happē by al circumstances which feare (onely witty in such inuention) can offer to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, making them much more grieuous and intolerable in the apprehension, then they afterwards proue to the sense and feeling. Whereas the brutish creatures are onely affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with present euils, neither grieuing for those which are past, nor fearing those which are to come, but haue in their whole life full security in the fruition of their pleasures, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept onely that tyme wherein they are pinched and vexed with sense of paine. If therefore religion, and the light of Gods word can not make vs thus wise to put off our mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, till God call vs to suffer them, and layeth the load vpon vs; yet shaming to come behinde brute beastes, let vs learne this wisdome by their example, not to make our selues mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable<note place="margin">Quotiēs incerta sint omnia tibi faue: crede quod mauis. Senec. epist. 13.</note> before our time; but if reason helpe to discouer euils before they come, let it also helpe vs to vse all good meanes that we may preuent thē; and whilest we are doubtful of the euent, let vs temper our feare with hope; and (as one coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saileth vs) whilest there is vncertainty, let vs fauour our selues by beleeuing that which wee had rather should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:10735:54"/> and so though we doe not gaine freedome, and be fully acquited of our miseries, yet shall wee be repreeued from them, and receiue no hurt vntill they touch vs; though we erre in hoping, yet it is more safe and profitable then to erre in fearing▪ seeing that brings comfort, but this torment and vexation. And though at last the euils foreseene doe fall vpon vs yet we shall gaine the comfort of all the tyme vntill they happen, and bee the better able to beare them when they come; seeing they shall find our strength intire, and not wasted with forerunning sorrowes and cares, which feare bringeth alwaies to those who giue way vnto it.

If therefore we would be the better armed and prepared, to indure affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions when they are inflicted, two things are to bee obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, when they are but threatned or feared; the first is, that wee doe not suffer our selues to bee deiected with feare and sorrow, when there is any suspicion of future euils, and so giue the first part to be acted by passion, which wil blind the mind, disturbe the heart, and so bring al out of frame and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but that in the first place, wee imploy our reason and iudgement to discerne, whether the euils which feare is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to apprehend, wil indeede certainely befall vs, or onely stand vpon likelyhood and probability. For naturally wee are apt to vexe our selues with causlesse iealousies, &amp; need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse suspicions, to loose our present comforts, and to marre
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:10735:54"/> all our mirth, when wee heare but a rumour of approaching euils, fearing and trembling, but neuer examining the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of our feare; and running away and fleeing from those enemies, which onely our imagination hath fained. Like (as<note place="margin">Senec. epist 13.</note> one speaketh) to such dasterdly souldiers, as are ready to leaue their standing vpon euery false alarme, and to forsake their fortifications, when they see dust raysed by an heard of cattell, thinking that a mighty army approacheth to assault them. Which cowardly follie that we may not fall into, let vs iudge of approaching euils before we feare them, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, whether they are likely to come, before wee vexe our minds with their apprehension, as if already they had befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len vs. And to this end let vs consider, that as we fall into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny afflictions which we neuer foresaw; so wee foresee many in conceipt, which in truth neuer happen. And as there are many occurrents and vnexpected accidents, which crosse, our hopes, and snatch from vs the good things we desire, when wee are ready to receiue, and to haue the fruition of them: so there are no fewer vnlooked-for helps, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent our miseries when they are ready to light vpon vs, or presently pull vs from them, when they doe but touch vs. And not seldome doth the Lord, to shew his infinite power and wisdome, grant deliuerance when all hopes faile, and all meanes forsake vs, pulling our heads euen from the blocke, and making vs to suruiue those who were appointed to bee our executioners.

Let vs know that many more things fright vs, then pinch vs, and that wee are more often pained with a false opinion, then with any reall hurt. It is follie to make our selues miserable before the approach of miserie, seeing, euils feared often happen not, or at least, are not alre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die happened. Let vs consider that false feares do beget true griefe, for by a strong apprehension they presse euils vpon
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:10735:55"/> vs, as if they were already present, and so whilest wee feare least wee should heereafter suffer them, wee euen now suffer them by fearing, and as men astonished know not what they doe, so we by feare are so amated, that whilest ouer earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we desire to escape afflictions, we in flying fall into them, That he who is giuen ouer to the passion of feare, can neuer bee at quiet, for in time of affliction hee is vexed with that which he suffereth, and euen whilest he liueth in prosperitie he hath no comfort, seeing by expecting of future crosses, he forgoeth the fruition of present blessings, and loseth them for feare of losing them. That vaine feares which haue no ground but rumor and suspition, doe commonly more tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">Senec. ibid.</note> vs, then those which haue a true cause, and some reall existence; for (as one saith) true things are confined in some<note place="margin">In aequo est dolor amissae rei et ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor amittendae. Senec. epist. 98.</note> measure; but those which are vaine and vncertaine haue no bounds, but are left onely to exorbitant coniecture, and to the vnlimited liberty of a fearing mind: that the feare of loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the comforts wee inioy, is as greeuous and intolerable as the greefe which accompanieth their losse, yea in this res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect worse, in that we know what we grieue for, and so how to find remedy by arming our patience against a knowne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill with approued arguments, whereas feare is alwaies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, changing and varying into a thousand shapes, not according to the truth of things, but the opinion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of him that feareth. That wee shall easily suffer those afflictions which being layd vpon vs by God are vnauoyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, if we do not with fruitlesse remembrance recall those which are past, and with bootlesse feare anticipate and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend those which are to come; seeing they are few and short that presently torment the body and vexe the mind,<note place="margin">tes in ipsis mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rijs sunt, quam ante illas.

                  </gap> rather by al lawfull meanes flee from euils, till they ouertake and catch vs; then to runne vnto them when yet they are farre off, and to pull them vnto vs, when as yet they doe not touch vs? why should wee not delay at least those miseries which wee cannot wholly es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape; seeing if it be best in our owne conceipt, to bee freed from them altogether, it is good also to auoid them as long as may bee? and why should wee ouerskip our comforts as though wee could neuer soone enough come at sorrow, and not rather reioyce in their fruition whilest wee may haue them, and leaue that time alone to greefe and discontent, wherein wee are vexed with sense of euill, and can find no cause of ioy? yea (will some say) but how should I preuent this feare, seeing I am naturally inclined to it? I answere that seeing we are reasonable creatures, wee must not like bruit beasts, giue our selues ouer to bee ruled by sense and passion, but in all things submit our selues to the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:10735:56"/> of reason, whom God hath made vice-roy in this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle world of man, not giuing way to our turbulent affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but onely when they haue warrantize from this their soueraigne. And so shal we not feare future euills, which are vncertaine, because reason will tell vs that wee may escape them, and therefore it is folly to take certaine sorrow for such crosses as are vncertaine; neither will it suffer vs to grieue for such afflictions as are certaine, because such griefe is bootlesse, and to no purpose; or if it haue at all any vse, it is to ease our selues when we feele the smart, and not when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet vntouched, wee onely see it. A second meanes to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid these causlesse and fruitlesse feares, is to auoide melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholike idlenesse, whereby they are both bred and nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed; and to exercise our selues with all diligence in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest works of our callings; for if our minds bee taken vp with these imployments, they will haue no leisure to fancie these feares, nor to giue them strength (after they are concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) by reuoluing them in our imaginations; neither indeed shall we, beeing thus imployed, haue cause to feare any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching euils, seeing the <hi>Lord will giue his Angels charge</hi>

For howsoeuer we are not, by a cowardly and timerous apprehension, to torment our selues with crosses before they come; yet must we wisely foresee them, that we may preuent those which may lawfully be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoided, and confirme our patience against them, which wee know will necessarily befal vs. Though we may not discouer our enemies before they approach, that we may cowardlie feare them, and idlely fit still and bewaile our future ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw before the fight, or else amazedly betake our selues to flight, when as yet we are not assaulted nor pursued: so must we not retchlesly and securely presume, that we are in safetie, till we fall into their ambushments; but like good souldiers we must keepe as vigilant centry in the tyme of peace or truce, as in the tyme of warre; discouer the number and strength of our enemies, and furnish our selues with sufficient forces, that we may manfully indure their assaults, and victoriously ouercome. Though whilest we sayle in this sea of miseries, we should not foresee tempests, that we may fit still, and idely lament them; yet like good pilots, wee ought in the faire weather of prosperitie, to foresee the stormes of aduersitie, that hauing all things in readinesse, we

And thus our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ requireth, that as hee who mindeth to build a tower, sitteth downe before, and counteth the cost, whether he haue sufficient to performe it; least hauing laide the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and not being able to finish it, all that behold it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to mocke him; and as a King being to make warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another, sitteth downe first, and taketh counsel, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be able to meete and incounter his enemy when hee inuadeth him; or otherwise is ready to send his ambassadors to treat on conditions of peace: so we, before we are assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">Luke. 14. 28. 31</note> by afflictions; must foresee and consider of the power of these enemies, and what strength we haue, eyther in respect of our owne spiritual graces, or the aides &amp; succours, which we assuredly expect from God, whereby we may be ascertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that we shall be inabled to withstand their fury, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the victory, that if wee finde our forces sufficient, wee may be comforted and incouraged, or if they bee weake and feeble, we may labour to haue them supplied and releeued against the day of battell.

                  </note> the world, but vse the benefits of this life, as though we vsed them not, and inioy them so, as those who are presently to forgoe them. For those things which we possesse with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate loue, we lose with immoderate griefe; and if wee looke vpon our temporall blessings, as vpon perpetuities, we shall subiect our selues to much sorrow, and finde small patience, when their losse proueth vnto vs that they were but moueables. For example, when we are honoured in the world, and haue euery mans tongue as a trumpet for our prayse: let vs consider that the tyme may come, when wee shall bee as much disgraced and defamed, and that those who cry <hi>Hosanna,</hi> will soone after cry as loude <hi>Crucifige;</hi> for this hath befallen to many before vs, and will happen to many after vs; and why then not vnto vs also among the rest? And vpon this meditation let vs examine our selues, how wee should beare it, if wee should be thus cast downe out of the high throne of honour, into the lowest bottome of shame and disgrace; and with what reasons and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wee might confirme our patience, and mitigate and moderate our griefe and heauinesse. So when we abound with riches, and haue such plenty of earthly things, that we haue not onely for our selues a sufficiency of all wee can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, but are also able to giue vnto others, and make all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout vs beholding for our benefites, let vs think that (as it hath beene the case of many) our plenty may be turned into pouertie and penurie; and how we may then retaine our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:10735:58"/> when wee are constrained by want to beg of those whom wee haue releeued, when in stead of our beds of doulne, wee must lye vpon the straw or hard boords, when our soft and shyning silkes shall bee changed into raggs or home spun russet, and our costly cates and delicate wines, shall be turned into course and scant fare, browne bread and cold water. When we haue our health and strength, let vs not conceiue that they are durable or permanent, but that the tyme will come, when being tormented with grieuous sicknesse we shall tosse and tumble vpon our restlesse beds, drinke loathsome potions, no lesse distastfull then the sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse which they should cure, haue no appetite to our meat and drink, or to such onely from which by rules of Physick we are restrained; and be so enfeebled, that we must be faine to repeate our first learned lesson of standing and going; and then examine our hearts how we could beare these afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; that finding our weaknesse, we may before they come arme our selues with patience against the time of triall. So when wee are at liberty, let vs prepare our selues to suffer imprisonment, where wee shall haue light dyet and heauy boults, indure the absence of our friends, and the insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of our iaylours. When wee are in our country, let vs consider that the tyme may come, when being exiled, wee shall heare nothing but a strange language which wee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not, and finde as strange entertaintment and small comfort, when we stand most in need of it, in respect of our miserie. And finally, when we take our greatest delight in our friends and acquaintance, let vs call to minde that they are not onely mortall, and may be taken from vs; but also so mutable, that of our neerest friends they may become our greatest enemies; that our louing parents, vnder the shadow of whose prouidence wee are sheelded and sustained, and by whose wisedome wee are gouerned, may euen the next day be taken from vs, and leaue vs orphanes; that our belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued children, which are the comforts of our youth, and the proppes of our old age, may by their death depriue vs of our
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:10735:59"/> present ioy and future hopes, that our deere wiues in whose loue and sweet society we now reioyce, are subiect to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and that the tyme may shortlie come, when as by death (as it were by a dead palsie) we shal loose the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vse of these halues of our selues; &amp; haue them plucked from vs with no lesse griefe, then if the mēbers of our bodies were torne in sunder. That our friends and acquaintance, who now smile vpon vs in our prosperitie, may with our estate change their countenance, not onely forsaking vs in our afflictions, but vexing vs also with the burthen of their vnkindnesses, and trying and tyring our patience with their wrongs, more then all the iniuries and outrages offered by our enemies. In a word, whatsoeuer wee may lose of that which wee most loue, let vs thinke that it is now in losing, or suppose it already lost; that wee may be the better armed and prepared to beare these losses, when in truth they shall befall vs; and haue weapons readie in our hands, to defend vs from being wounded with impatiency and immoderate griefe in our conflict with these afflictions. And if we thus possesse our worldly comforts, two great benefites will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low heereupon: the first, that we shall not be made drunke with prosperitie, nor be puffed vp with pride in the conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of earthly blessings, and become insolent; but vse them with all sobrietie and good conscience, when as our expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, like a continuall monitour, doth put vs in minde of our losse; for who can swell in the fruition of such bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites which are so momentanie &amp; mutable? And the other is, that this daily expectation wil make these afflictions, which in themselues are grisly and terrible, so well knowne and familiar, that when they appeare they will not much skare and affright vs. A notable example whereof we haue in the<note place="margin">Anaxagoras a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud Plutarch. de tranquil. animi.</note> heathen man, who being certified of the death of his deare and worthy sonne, heard it with patience without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance of passion, because (as he said) he knew when he begot him, that he was mortall, and had brought him vp in expectation of this mortality. Whereas these losses when
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:10735:59"/> they are vnexpected and vnthought of, doe the more asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe vs when they happen, and doe more torment vs with their feare then with their smart. As the same Author shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the example of <hi>Vlisses,</hi> who at his cōming home (after his twenty yeares peregrination) vnto his most louing and beloued wife, wept not when she wept, because before his comming he was armed against passion, by the expectation of this ioyfull mourning at their meeting, but yet could not refraine teares at the suddaine death of his dogge which he loued, because this accident comming vnlooked for, tooke him vnprouided. And vnto these benefites wee may adde that this expectancie will make vs to enioy with more true comfort whatsoeuer wee loue, when as our ioy in the fruition of it, is not appalled and abated with our feare, wee being named already against these losses, and will make them whilest we haue them more sweet and delightfull. For whereas the first possession of earthly things, whilest they are yet new, is most pleasing, this continuall expectation of their losse doth make them to seeme euery day (which we enioy them afterwards) as new gotten and gained, and with more welcome, because they come as an ouer-plus aboue our hopes.</p>
               <p>If therefore wee would haue patience and comfort in the<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 9. That we must not be secure in prosperity, but forecast what euils may befall vs.</hi>

Which that we may the rather doe, let vs further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that our prouidence and foresight of afflictions will preuent many of them, and lessen all; neither doth it at all hasten their speed (as many imagine who dare not intertaine into their thoughts any conceit of euils to come, nor can with patience haue any warning giuen of them by others, as though the very naming of them were ominous, and did presage some mischiese towards them) but onely maketh our crosses lighter and easier when they come, &amp; vs strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to beare and suffer them.

And as afflictions foreseene, become much weaker, so we also much the stronger to beare and ouercome them; partly because before the incounter we haue time to arme our selues with resolution, and to gather together the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our mindes, which being vnited, are of great strength to ouercome all difficulties, and to beare the greatest waight of calamitie and misery; wheras if we be assaulted at vnawares, and fal into the ambush of afflictions, when neuer thinking of an enemie, we haue these our chiefe forces scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and disordered through deepe security; then shall small and weake forces of aduersitie discomfit and put vs to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:10735:60"/> flight, euen at the first assault, and wee shall receiue a finall ouerthrowe before wee haue time to make an head, or so much as to aduize of any meanes to make resistance. And partly because by exercising our selues against expected e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, as though they were present, we receiue much strength and abilitie to beare them when they come; euen as a man by vsing to fight at foyles, is made both more skilfull and bould to fight at sharpe; and by skirmishing among his friends and fellow souldiars, becommeth more cunning, hardy and valiant in encountring of his enemies; whereas, if we spend our time of prosperitie in deepe securitie, wee will neither prouide armour against the assaults of affliction, or if we had it in store, we shall not be able to beare it; and for want of exercise, wee shall grow so weake and pursie, that we shall not bee able to hold out in the first encounter. And therefore, if we would beare the burthen of afflictions when it is inflicted, let vs often in our meditations, volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarilie<note place="margin">Magna pars est apud imperitos mali, nouitas etc. Senec. epist. 76.</note> (as it were) poize it before it bee imposed; seeing (as one saith) the greatest part of the euils which improuident men sustaine, is caused through their noueltie and vnexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted suddainesse; as it may heereby plainly appeare, in that those miseries, which at their first comming, they bewaile as intolerable, they doe afterwards being inured to them, beare them with patience; the which may moue wise men, to make themselues acquainted with future euils, by think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them before they happen, and to make those afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons light by meditating on them, which are made light vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, by their customable bearing them.</p>
               <p>The sixth rule is, that hauing in our meditations disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered<note place="margin">Sect. 10. The sixth rule, that we must not securely contemne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, nor faintly yeeld vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</note> these enemies approaching, and plainly discerned by manifest reasons, or great probabilitie, that we are likely to be encountred with afflictions and calamities; wee doe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther securely contemne the forces of these enemies; nor faintly yeeld vnto them before we are assaulted. The former of these two euils is to be auoided, because there is scarce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny force so weake, which is not sufficient to vanquish a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:10735:61"/> enemie, seeing he keepeth no watch, nor maketh any prouision, whereby hee might be armed and strengthened against the assault; but being drunke with long prosperitie, lyeth snorting in the dead sleepe of carelesnesse and supine negligence, whereby being depriued of al strength, he is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily vanquished, as being rather a prey, lying open to the spoyle, then an enemy, which by fight must bee ouercome. And therefore that wee may not bee thus indangered with this security, let vs when we see afflictions approaching, be content to entertaine a valerous feare, which may moue vs to arme our selues against the assault, though not a feare of cowardize, which would make vs to faint and flee away; and labour to bee as farre from presumptuous securitie, as from the other extreame of dastardly amazednesse; seeing it is no vnusuall thing, for them who neglect the meane, to run out of one extreame into another, and to become ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous cowards when they are incountred, who were quite without prouident feare, and desperatly secure in the time of preparation. And to this end let vs not onely looke vpon afflictions, as vpon euils which must be borne, or ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to bee resisted, but as they are the iudgments of God, wherewith he punisheth our sinnes, or at least fatherly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stizements, which he would haue vs to feare moderately for our amendement; like sonnes, that we may sue for pardon, though not like slaues, that we may fly away. For he who contemneth his correction, is neuer like to be reformed by it. And this the Apostle requireth, <hi>My sonne</hi> (saith hee) <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise not the chastening of the Lord:</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> practized,<note place="margin">Heb 12. 6.</note> where he cryeth out, <hi>My flesh trembleth for feare of thee, and I am afraide of thy iudgments.</hi> As also <hi>Iosias,</hi> whose heart did<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 120.</note> melt when he did but heare the threatnings of the law. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine we shall haue but litle cause to contemne afflictions, if wee consider our owne weaknesse, and want of patience, whereby we are ready to sinke vnder the lightest burthen, &amp; to faint and yeeld in the least assault, if wee be not assisted and strengthened with the power of Gods might; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:10735:61"/> we haue iust cause to feare lest being foyled and oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with their waight, we be moued in impatiency to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure and repine against Gods prouidence, and euen to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme him to his face.</p>
               <p>But on the other side, as we are not to contemne afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when we see them approaching; so wee must not cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly flye away, nor basely yeeld vnto them, as despairing of victorie: as we must not be possessed with presumptuous security, in confidence of our owne strength, and our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies weakenes; so we must bee bold and couragious in the power of Gods might, and assurance of his assistance, when we most need his helpe, and as wee must <hi>not despise the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stening</hi>

So the three children<note place="margin">Dan. 3. 18.</note> rather then they would worship <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> image, constantly resolued to indure those tortures in the fiery fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace. And <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> rather then they would surcease to preach the Gospel, resolued couragiously to passe through al dangers, neglected the threatnings of the high Priest, and<note place="margin">Act. 5. 29.</note> the rest of the councell, and feared not to hazard their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:10735:62"/> bodies to the whip, chusing to obey God, though they were tormented for it, rather then to obey men in their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull commands, and so to enioy their liberty and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from dangers. Thus also the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> armed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with a constant and Christian resolution to preach Christ, though heereby hee indangered himselfe both to bands and death: yea so strong was he in faith and patience,<note place="margin">Act. 21. 13.</note> that he triumpheth ouer all afflictions, and couragiously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solueth that no extremities should deuide Christ and him; <hi>Who</hi> (saith he) <hi>shall separate vs from the loue of Christ? shal tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation; or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakednes, or</hi>

               <p>The last rule to be obserued &amp; practised in the time of our<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 11. The eighth rule, that we must not wilfully run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to afflictions.</hi>
                  </note> preparatiō, is that we do not wilfully run into afflictions, nor pul the crosse vpō our own shoulders; but that we diligently vse al good means, eyther to escape them before they come; or to bee freed from them, when they are inflicted on vs. Concerning the former, as we ought not to flee those ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies through cowardly feare in the vse of vnlawful meanes; so must we not prouoke them to assault vs when wee might liue in peace; as wee must not hide our selues from them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the couert of sinfull shifts, when they are sent of God to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:10735:62"/> finde vs; so wee must not voluntarily seeke them, and dare them to incounter vs, when they would be quiet and meane vs no harme, and finally as wee must not shamefully retire when God soundeth the alarme to battell▪ nor pull backe our shoulder when he enioyneth vs to beare the crosse; so must we not disorderly march on when hee soundeth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait, nor thrust our selues vnder a load of our owne making which he neuer laid vpon vs; for as the sonne of <hi>Syrach</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, <hi>he that loueth danger shall perish therein.</hi> Neither is it<note place="margin">Eccles. 3. 27.</note> required that we should fill this bitter cup of afflictions vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our selues, but onely that we drinke of it when God put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it into our hands; nor that we should make crosses, but onely beare them, according to the example of our Sauiour Christ, who did not carry his crosse, til it was laid vpon him. For otherwise we do not take vpon vs the crosse, but wring it (as it were) out of Gods hand; wee doe not submit our selues vnto his will, but rather doe our owne; the which is not fortitude but madnesse, which will not bring any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in our sufferings; seeing we cannot incourage our selues with the saying of our Sauiour, <hi>shall I not drinke of the cuppe which my Father hath giuen me?</hi> it beeing a mixture of our<note place="margin">Iohn 18. 11.</note> owne making, and a potion of our owne prouiding. Now if wee would know how to discerne Gods crosses from our owne, wee may easily distinguish them by this one rule, namely that God calleth vs then onely to suffer, when wee haue no lawfull meanes to auoid the affliction; and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise we thrust our selues vnder the burthen; when with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sinne, and with a good conscience, we might escape the danger, but chuse rather wilfully to run into it. An example whereof wee haue in the Papists, who impouerish their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states by voluntary pouerty, and torment their bodies with pilgrimages, penance of their owne deuising, whipping and scourging, resembling herein the ancient <hi>Lac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:10735:63"/> before their idols: whose practise let vs auoid, not going as voluntaries into the skirmish of afflictions, but staying our time til we are pressed and called out by our great comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; not pulling crosses vpon vs, in which wee can haue no comfort, seeing therein wee yeeld no obedience vnto God but serue our owne wils, and follow our owne fantasies; but patiently bearing those onely which wee are assured that God hath laid vpon vs, because wee haue no lawfull meanes to shun and auoid them. And to this end let vs consider, that this voluntary thrusting of our selues into needlesse afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is expresly contrary to Gods commandements; as if they concerne our bodies, we sinne against the sixth Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, which as it requireth that we doe not any way hurt our neighbours body, but vse all good meanes to doe them good; so also first and principally, that wee doe no harme to our owne bodies, but vse all good meanes to preserue them in their health &amp; strength, or if it concerne our goods and estate, against the eighth commandement, which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth no lesse the preseruation of our owne estate, then of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother mans; and forbiddeth the wilful wasting of our owne substance, to our vndoing and impouerishing, as well as the robbing and spoyling of our neighbour. So our Sauiour Christ hath commanded vs to vse lawfull meanes for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoiding of afflictions, and that when <hi>they persecute vs in one</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth, 10. 23. 24. 16.</note>

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:10735:64"/> and patience to indure these wilfull trialls. For heerein we resemble stubborne and foolish children, who wilfully fall that their parents may catch hold of them, and being down, lye still and crye, but neuer offer to rise, because they expect to be helped vp by others. And this is the sinne vnto which our Sauiour Christ was tempted by the Deuill, but resisted the tentation, alleadging that it is written, that <hi>wee must not tempt the Lord our God.</hi> We our selues continually pray that<note place="margin">Matth. 4. 7.</note> we may not be led into tentation, but that we may be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from euill; and therefore seeing afflictions are strong tentations, whereby the deuil and the world labour to draw vs to the committing of sinne, as impatiency, murmuring &amp; repining against God, doubting of his prouidence and such like, &amp; seeing they are euils of punishment, which are threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against sin; therefore we must not wilfully cast our selues into these tentations, into which wee pray that we may not be led, nor of our owne accord runne into those euils, from which we intreat at Gods hands that we may be deliuered. For whatsoeuer we lawfully desire by prayer, that we are to labor after in the vse of al good meanes that we may obtain it; and that which we pray against wee are bound to vse the like meanes to shun and auoid it, desiring God to giue vs grace, that we may carefully and prosperously vse them, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the gaining of the one, or escaping of the other, which if we doe not, we doe but play the hypocrites, praying with our lips for that w<seg rend="sup">c</seg> our hearts desire not. So that as we must not wilfully plunge our selues into tentations; so must we contrariwise vse all good means to shun afflictiōs before they happen, and to be deliuered from them if already wee bee ouertaken by them; as namely wee must vse the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes of Physicke, to preuent or cure our sicknesses, industrious labour in our calling, to preserue vs from po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty; or to bee freede from it, if wee bee fallen into it, the authoritie and assistance of magistrates, to defend vs from iniuries and oppression; or to recouer our right of which which wee are depriued by force and violence; and

The which is waranted vnto vs, not onely by those testimonies of Scripture, before alleaged, but also by the example of the Saints of God from time to time.

And thus he escaped bonds by pleading the priuiledge of a citizen of Rome; and made a great party on his side to defend him from raging violence, by professing himselfe to be a Pharisie. Yea our Sauiour Christ himselfe, who came into the world to suffer for vs, did flee persecution vntill the appointed time came; and euen then being affrighted with that heauy burthen which hee was to beare, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring to drinke of that bitter potion prepared for him, he did instantly desire, (though with submission of his will to his heauenly father's) that this cup might passe from him.

Neither is it fit that wee should sit still, and effeminatly complaine when wee are in any misery and calamitie,; but as it beseemeth a manly disposition, we must aduise with our selues, take counsaile of others, and labour and endeauour in the vse of all lawfull meanes to escape af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, or to ouercome them, if we cannot auoyde them. Nor is it enough that wee desire deliuerance, or implore by prayer Gods assistance to free vs from trouble; but as the wise Pilote doth prouide all things necessary against the tempest, and vseth them with all care and diligence when the storme commeth, and so craueth Gods blessing vpon his
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:10735:65"/> endeauours, because without this, his paines and prouidēce become vaine and fruitlesse; so must we take the same course in all dangers and troubles (hauing holy <hi>Iacob</hi> for our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, who though he had wrastled with God al the night, by prayers and strong cryes, and had preuailed, yet he ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth<note place="margin">Genes. 32.

But yet in the vse of all meanes to free vs from afflictions, we must carefully obserue these rules: first that they be lawfull and warrantable, not wicked and sinful, least that reproofe of <hi>Elihu,</hi> intended against <hi>Iob,</hi> bee iustly applyed vnto vs, <hi>that we chuse iniquity rather then affliction;</hi>

For besides that, hee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardeth himselfe to the suffering of these endlesse torments for the time to come, that he may be eased of present smart; he doth through the iust iudgment of God faile oftentimes of his purpose, &amp; lieth stil vnder the crosse which he thought to haue auoided. And not seildome whilest he thus escapeth one misery, he falleth at vnawares into a farre greater, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no more ease and comfort, by all his vnlawfull shifts then the seelie fish which leapeth out of the frying pan into the fire. And whereas he might haue borne the hand of God in the former afflictions with greater patience, because hee had inwardly the testimony of a good conscience to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him; and outwardly the sweet odour of a good name, he is by his wicked shifts robbed of both, and is forced to beare his more heauie crosses with the terrours of an euill conscience, and deserued infamy and reproach. The second
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:10735:65"/> caution is, that in vsing these meanes wee doe referre the issue to the good pleasure of God, and submit our wills to<note place="margin">Math. 6. 39.</note> his will, saying with our Sauiour, <hi>Father let this cup passe from me, howbeit not my will, but thine be done;</hi> for as much as he knoweth bettet then our selues what is fit for vs, and will according to his promise in time conuenient, giue a good issue out of the tentation. And lastly, we must take heed least in vsing the meanes we trust in them, and leauing the Lord, who is the supreame cause of our deliuerance, doe rest vpon our owne prouidence, and vpon inferiour causes, which are but his instruments; like vnto <hi>Asa</hi> who trusted in the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians for the recouery of his health; for thē we shal rob God of his glorie, and in stead of returning the praise of our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerāce vnto him, we wil, with those whom the Prophet <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backuck</hi>

And also the knowledge of our selues, that wee are most wicked and damnable sinners, who by our manifold and haynous transgressions, haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued to haue the full vials of Gods wrath to bee powred vpon vs; and therefore great reason we haue to beare these lesser afflictions with patience and thankesgiuing, seeing we haue iustly deserued the greatest, euen the eternall condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation both of our bodies and soules. Vnto this knowledge I adde faith, by which we beleeue and apply vnto our selues all wee know for our owne vse and benefit; for beleeuing that God is our gracious father in Christ, and apprehending all Gods gracious promises of the Gospell as due vnto vs; and particularly those which assure vs of Gods assistance, and of our deliuerance out of all afflictions, we beare with patience these crosses that are layde vpon vs. The other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces named, as they are the fruites of this faith, so are the causes of our patience, as namely affiance in God, whereby beleeeing his promises, we rest vpon him in all troubles and dangers; and hope, whereby we expect and waite for with patience the accomplishment of them; and finally, loue of God which proceedeth from the assurance of his loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs; the which especially doth worke in vs, confirme, and increase our patience, according to the saying of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle; <hi>Loue suffereth all things, it beleeueth all things, it hopeth</hi>

It is true that they gaue many precepts of patience, which make a faire shew at the first sight; as prouerbially it was said among them, that we must beare and forbeare, so some haue taught that felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<note place="margin">Arist. in ethick.</note> consisteth not in wordly prosperity, but in the exercise &amp; practise of vertue, &amp; consequently that a vertuous man may bee happie though afflicted; yea that by aduersity wee haue occasion so to exercise vertue, that it wil appeare more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and glorious, the Stoicks taught that there is no euill in affliction, but onely that it is euill to abandon vertue and follow vice; and to the same purpose the oratour saith, that besides vice and dishonesty, nothing can befall a man wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at he should bee danted and appalled. And the practise also of many of them was according to these precepts; for so we read of <hi>Horatius P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And the like magnanimous patience they shewed in suffering perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall afflictions: as <hi>Aristides</hi> in his banishment: <hi>Scipio</hi> in those indignities which his vngratefull countrimen offered vnto him; <hi>Regulus</hi> in his exquisite torments. But yet this was no true patience, because it flowed not from those sauing gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the knowledge of God, faith, affiance and hope; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was done in obedience to Gods will, and ioyned with

An example of this qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et peacefulnes, and meeke silence, wee haue in <hi>Dauid,</hi> who <hi>was dumb, and opened not his mouth because it was God that did afflict him;</hi> and in <hi>Iob,</hi> who in his great extremities checketh<note place="margin">Iob. 39. 37.</note> himselfe for hauing bin too talkatiue in his complaints; and professeth for the time to come, <hi>that he would lay his hand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his mouth, keepe silence and speake no more.</hi> But aboue all examples is that of our Sauiour Christ, who in his manifold

               <p>But howsoeuer this vnruely vnquietnes and vehemencie of passion is to be auoided of all those, who would possesse<note place="margin">Chrysost. serm. ad populum. 5.

Because all sorrow which is for any thing, hauing no reference or respect to sinne, is vain and vnprofitable, yea oftentimes hurtfull and pernicious; or if it doe any good at all, it is not by lessening of the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but only as it easeth the heart by venting of that greefe, which being retained, would suffocate or breake it, in which regard sorrow is only to be intertained in respect of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward expressing therof, as a meanes to vnburthen the mind, and not to loade it, vpon necessity to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For whereas there are seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall medicines which are proper and peculiar for euery dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:10735:69"/> which being rightly applied doe effect the cure; but if cōtrariwise that which is fit for one be applied vnto another, in stead of helping, it much hurteth &amp; increaseth the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the disease: so the medicines that helpeth the diseases of the hand, are vnprofitable or pernitious, being applied to the heart; &amp; that which helps the hearing, would being mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applied, put out the eyes; sorrow and greefe is appointed by God to be a medicine proper and peculiar for the curing of sinne; and being rightly applied vnto it, and in fit proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it doth cure and heale it; but if it be misapplied vnto our crosses and calamities as vnto sicknesse, pouerty, death of friends and worldly losses, it doth not lessen or take them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but rather much aggrauates and increaseth them, like the worme in the nut, eating the heart in which it is bred; and doing vs more true hurt and damage, then all other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series which we lament and sorrow for.</p>
               <p>But as there is an excesse and disorder of our sorrow,<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 5. That wee must not with the Stoicks affect sensles stupidity in our afflictions.</hi>
                  </note> when as eyther we mourne too much, or not for that which we ought cheefly to bewaile; so there is a defect thereof, when we greeue not at all, but like stocks haue no sense ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our fault, or of our punishment and correction. The which senslesnesse in bearing afflictions was so much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the Stoicks, who thought him alone magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and wise, who putting off al passion and affection (and with it humanity it selfe) carried himselfe at all times alike, both in prosperity and aduersitie, not affected with ioy in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny delights, nor with sorrow and greefe in any misery and affliction. But this is to turne a man into a stone or stocke, and to dreame of such a patience as neuer was or shall bee found among men; or if it could, yet hath not in it any mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity or Christian fortitude: but dull blockishnesse and senselesse stupidity. Yea in truth it is not onely an vnreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, but also a sensles dreame and dotage, contrary to the law of nature, which hath ordered that all liuing creatures should feare affliction and miserie before it come, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile it when it is inflicted: and so farre from true wisdome,

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:10735:71"/> despaire. Not such an one as is exempted from all dolour and anguish; but onely that it moderate this griefe with spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ioy, and meeke submission of our will to the pleasure of God. Neither doth God require that we should haue a patience, not at all pressed with any anxietie or sorrow of mind; but that being tyred with bearing the burthen, we be somewhat refreshed, and eased with the consolations of his word and holy Spirit. He would not haue vs vanquished in the combate of afflictions; but yet hee would haue vs fight vnto wearinesse, and not obtaine such a victorie, as hath had no conflict going before it. In a word, that conquest ouer the Crosse best pleaseth him, when as our naturall sight and sense, seeth, feeleth and abhorreth the afflictions which wee suffer, causing vs to grieue and grone vnder our burthen; &amp; in the meane time, our obedience and filiall affection to our heauenly father, so farre preuaileth, as that in the middest of all the difficulties and distresses, wee can bee content to submit our selues to his holy will, and beare the crosse with patience, which he hath layde vpon vs, vntill hee vouchsafe vs by lawfull meanes, freedome and deliuerie. And this the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth to bee the estate of all the faithfull, namely that in their afflictions they are touched with some sorrow in the sense and feeling of thē, but not so ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with griefe and heauinesse, but that being humbled, they rise againe, and get the victory ouer the violence of<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 8.</note> their passions. <hi>We are</hi> (saith he) <hi>afflicted on euery side, yet are we not in distresse; in pouertie, but not ouercome of pouertie; we are persecuted, but not forsaken; cast downe, but we perish not, &amp;c.</hi> An example whereof we haue in <hi>Peter,</hi> vnto whom our<note place="margin">Ioh. 21. 18.</note> Sauiour saith, <hi>When thou wast young, thou girdest thy selfe, and walkedst whether thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch out thine hands, and another shall gird thee, and lead thee whether thou wouldest not.</hi> By which speach we are not to vnderstand, that <hi>Peter</hi> would be simply vnwilling to suffer for Christ, for then his martyrdome had deserued no praise; but that howsoeuer hee was willing with all readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:10735:71"/> to lay downe his life for the glory of God; that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall feare which he had of death and torment drew him another way; so as hee was heereby distracted betweene a twofold will of grace and nature; the one shunning death, the other yeelding obedience to the will of God, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a sore conflict he could not put feare to slight, nor get victorie ouer his naturall affection. So <hi>Paul</hi> professed that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e was ready not onely to suffer bonds but death it selfe, for<note place="margin">Act 21. 13.</note> the name of the Lord Iesus: but yet that naturall desire of preseruing his life, and auoiding torments, so farre preuail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he vseth all good meanes to escape affliction and persecution, professing that he was a Pharisie, and a citizen of Roome, reproouing the high Priest, who caused him to bee vniustly smitten; and auoiding the laying in waite of those who sought his life. But most notably doth this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in our Sauiour Christ himselfe, who was exceedingly distracted with this double will; the one naturall, whereby hee earnestly desired to preserue his precious life, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape those fearful punishments which he was to suffer, both in his soule and body: the other diuine and spirituall where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he desired to glorifie his father, by submitting himselfe in all things to his holy will; and to perfect the worke of mans redemption whom hee so dearly loued. Whereof it was that he could not without a great conflict submit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to those grieuous sufferings, but first desireth; <hi>Father if it be thy will, let this cup passe from me:</hi> and after yeeldeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience<note place="margin">Matth. 26. 39.</note> to his fathers pleasure; <hi>Neuerthelesse, not mine, but thy will be done.</hi> And thus it appeareth, that moderate sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in the time of affliction, may well stand and agree with that patience which the Scriptures describe vnto vs. In the third place I adde, that this moderate griefe which is eased and refreshed with diuine consolation is warranted, yea commanded in the Scriptures. The former is implied, where the Apostle requireth that we should not mourne for them<note place="margin">1. Thess. 4. 13.</note> that are departed in the faith of Christ, as men without hope; where hee taxeth and forbiddeth onely heathenish
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:10735:72"/> mourning, which was excessiue and immoderate, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth such a proportion as is fit for a temporarie depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So also where he saith, <hi>that we must not despise the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stening</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Thess. 4. 13.</note>

                  <hi>Suffer</hi> (saith he) <hi>afflictions and sorrow, ye and weepe, let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your ioy into heauinesse.</hi> Yea in truth this is the maine end which the Lord propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of our afflictions, that they may serue as his chastize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to bring vs to a sight and feeling of sinne, true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation and vnfained repentance, by smart and sense of paine; euen as the louing and wise father doth correct his sonne, that by the sense and smart of the rodde, hee may be brought to a sight of his fault and sorrow for it, and so may amend it for the time to come. And as it is a signe of an vngracious childe not to be grieued with his fathers corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and a great presumption that they will not amend him, if they doe not moue him: so doth this make it more then probable, that such are destitute of grace and filiall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and farre from reformation and amendement, who haue no sense and feeling of Gods correction, nor are brought by their smart to vnfained sorrow for their fall. Yea such haue iust cause to feare, that they are not at all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, seeing they are not affected with his fatherly chast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Or if they belong vnto Gods election, and haue the life of grace begun in them; if the Lord hath adopted them for his sons, and intendeth to bestow vpon them that heauenly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of his glorious kingdome; then let them assure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, that he wil not leaue them till he haue humbled them for their faults, and brought them to a sight of their sinne that they may bewaile it. And if his more gentle chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will not effect it, because the thick skin of securitie keepeth them from feeling the smart of his rods, hee will take in hand the three stringed whippe of his more grieuous iudgements, and more seuerely correct them, not leauing to redouble his blowes till their sense of paine hath brought them to a sight of sinne, to true humility and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their faults; and to an heartie sorrow, both natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall for the affliction, and spirituall for their sinne.

It is not enough for a Christian souldier, that he demeane himselfe well in the first conflict with afflictions, if he afterwards grow weary of fighting, &amp; flee out of the field by vsing vnlawfull meanes to escape; or fight faintly and not without grudging and murmuring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his commander, for bringing him into the troubles and dangers; but hee must constantly continue his courage and resolution, after one encounter expecting &amp; preparing himselfe to sustaine another, and neuer cease shewing his fortitude and vnwearied magnanimity, till hee haue obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a full and finall victory.

And this our Sauiour im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth, where he inioyneth vs to take vp our crosse; whereby as it is not meant, that we must voluntarily draw crosses vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:10735:75"/> our selues of our owne making, but our receiuing of those which it pleaseth God to lay vpon vs; so it signifieth that wee must not vndergoe &amp; beare them as a burthen for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vpon vs whether we will or no, with grudging and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining; but willingly, cheerefully, thankfully and with ioy in the holy Ghost. And these are the highest degrees of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, which though few attaine vnto in ful measure, yet all the faithfull desire and labour after them, vsing all good meanes to attaine vnto this perfection. Yea will some say, but before you required, that wee should bee affected with sorrow in our sufferings, and moderately mourne in our crosses and afflictions, and how then can wee at the same time reioyce, seeing ioy and mourning are opposite the one to the other? to which I answere that Christian sorrow and reioycing may well stand together, seeing the one maketh way for the other; for therefore we bewaile our sins, that we may reioyce in the assurance of the pardon of them, of our reconciliation with God, and of our interest in all the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promises of the Gospell. So that though wee giue the first part to bee acted by sorrow, yet wee would not haue it to continue alwaies in the hart of a Christian▪ for so it would grow immoderate and excessiue: but after this our vnfained repentance for sinne, and assurance of pardon and our peace with God, followeth spirituall reioycing, not onely in the confluence of worldly benefits, but also in tribulation and affliction, as the Apostle speaketh. Againe, opposites may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in the same subiect, at the same time in a diuers respect,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 3.</note> for so we may mourne because by our sinnes we haue cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Lord of life, but reioyce in that by his death hee hath wrought the worke of our redemption, we may at the same time mourne in the sight of our sinnes, because wee haue dishonoured by them our gratious Father, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in that our sorrow assureth vs that they are forgiuen, and we receiued into Gods fauour, wee may mourne in the sense of our paine and smart, but yet reioyce in it, as it is a signe of our adoption, when God correcteth vs as his sons,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:10735:76"/> that we may not bee condemned with the world; wee may mourne in the sight of our miseries, as beeing the fruits of sin, but reioyce in them as they are meanes to mortifie the flesh and our naturall corruptions. Finally as wee haue iust cause of sorrowing, in that wee haue deserued that the Lord should depriue vs of all those worldly cōforts, so to be filled with ioy, when we consider <hi>that these light and momentanie affliction▪ shall cause vnto vs a farre most excellent and an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi>

Lastly, opposites may be in the same subiect in respect of diuers parts; now we are partly flesh, and partly spirit; and as in the one wee do in time of affliction, greeue and sorrow, groane and complaine, in the sense and feeling of our smart and paine; so in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we reioyce in the assurance of the pardon of our sinnes, and that the sting of afflictions i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:10735:77"/> in his fatherly chastizements, and those singular fruites, both respecting grace and glory, which doe not onely accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, but also follow after them. And in this regard our Sauiour willed his disciples, and with them all the faithfull, to reioyce and bee glad in their bitter afflictions and cruell persecutions, <hi>because their reward was great in heaue.</hi> So the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 11. 12</note>

                  <hi>they may be glad and reioyce.</hi> And this S. <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth in the behalfe of the Collossians, that with their patience and long suffering, there might be ioyned ioyfulnesse. An example<note place="margin">Act. 5. 41.</note> wherof we haue in the holy Apostles, who being afflicted &amp; persecuted for the profession of Christ, departed from the councel, reioycing that they were counted worthy to suffer rebuke for his name. So the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that hee reioyced in his sufferings for the Church of the<note place="margin">Col. 1. 24 1. Thess. 1. 6.</note> Collossians; and giueth testimonie to the Thessalonians, that they receiued <hi>the Gospell with much affliction, and with ioy of the holy Ghost.</hi> So of the faithfull Hebrewes it is said, that though they sorrowed with the Apostle for his bonds, <hi>yet they suffered with ioy the spoiling of their owne goods, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 34.</note>
                  <hi>that they had in heauen a better and more induring sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</hi> Neither did he onely thus reioyce in his suffering per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution for Christ and the profession of the Gospell, but in those spirituall afflictions which hee indured, in the sight and sense of his infirmities, when hee knew that in them Gods power and grace was aduanced and magnified: for hauing receiued answere, when he desired to be freed from them, that Gods grace was sufficient for him, and that his diuine power was made manifest in his humaine frailtie and weaknesse; he professeth <hi>that very gladly hee would reioyce in</hi>

                  <hi>his infirmities, that the power of Christ might dwell in him;</hi> yea that he did take pleasure as well in these infirmities, as in reproaches, necessities, persecution and anguish for Christs sake, because when he was weake in himselfe, he was strong
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:10735:78"/> in Christ. Finally, if wee desire to conforme our selues to the doctrine and example of the holy Apostles, we must not onely be patient, chearefull, ready to giue thankes, or yet reioyce in our afflictions in some small measure, and (as it were) with ordinary ioy and gladnesse; but with ioy very great, and as it were, in the highest degree; not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing, but euen triumphing, glorying and exsulting in our ioy. And as it is said of the <hi>Ostrich,</hi> that she doth not onely eate iron, but also disgesteth and turneth it into her nourishment; so must wee not onely be content (as it were) to swallow in filence and patience the difficulties of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which the carnall man can by no meanes disgest, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being sick vnto the death with sorrow and heauinesse; but we must labour also to suck out of them such holesome nourishment, at may exceedingly refresh and comfort vs. And <hi>Salamander</hi> like wee are not onely to liue, but also cheefely to reioyce in the fire of affliction and tribulation. For so the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> requireth, that we <hi>count it excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iam. 1. 2.</note>
                  <hi>ioy, when we fall into diuerse tentations,</hi> not in the sight of the afflictions themselues, but because wee know that they serue to increase in vs Gods spirituall graces, and that the trying of our faith bringeth forth patience, which in the end will attaine to such perfection, that it will lack nothing. And this the Apostle maketh a fruite of that fulnesse of faith which we must labour after; for after that it hath assured vs of the pardon of our sinnes, and of our peace with God, wee reioyce, yea glory and triumph, not onely in our hope of heauenly happinesse, but also in affliction and tribulation.<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 3.</note> An example whereof wee haue in the faithfull Corinthians, who as they abounded in the great trials of affliction, so their ioy also abounded; and in the Apostle himselfe, who<note place="margin">2. Cor. 8. 2.</note> professeth that hee <hi>was filled with comfort, and was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ioyous in all his tribulations;</hi> insomuch as when he would<note place="margin">2. Cor. 7. 4.</note> cheefly glory and shew such excellency, wherein hee was to be matched with the rest of the Apostles; he setteth downe<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. vers. 16. to the. 31.</note> a large bead-rowle of his many and grieuous afflictions, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:10735:78"/> concludeth, that if he must needs boast himselfe and reioice, he would reioice and glory in his infirmities.</p>
               <p>And this is the patience of the Saints, which euery faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full<note place="margin">Sect. 13. That none can attaine vnto perfection in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, but yet al must labour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it.</note> man must labour to attaine vnto, and neuer to be at rest vntill in some measure he be endued with it. It is true, that none can attaine vnto this perfection of patience, but those who are come to fulnesse of faith; and euen among Gods greatest Worthies, who had this fulnesse of perswasion, wee may obserue, that when their faith was shaken with gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous tentations, their patience also was crazed and much blemished with murmuring and complaining. As wee may see in iust <hi>Iob,</hi> the paterne of true patience, who by the<note place="margin">Iob. 3. 2. 3.</note> weight of his affliction, is moued to curse the day of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie;<note place="margin">Chap. 9. 33. 34. 35.</note> to complaine that God dealt against him by strong hand, and laide punishments vpon him which hee could hardly iustifie, if he might vpon equall tearmes dispute with him, or had some vmpire betweene them, who would indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently<note place="margin">Chap. 10. 16.</note> heare and iudge his cause. Yea as a desperately im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of enduring long misery, hee prouoketh God to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease his afflictions, to hunt him as a Lyon, and to shew himselfe meruailous vpon him. And this was the case of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Dauid,</hi> who vpon the occasion of his greeuous afflictions penned many Psalmes, full of dolefull complaints, which sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of much impatiency. And also of the good Prophet <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie,</hi> who in the bitternesse of his greefe curseth the day<note place="margin">Ier. 20. 14. 18.</note> wherein he was borne; and repineth against his creation, because hee came out of the wombe to see labour and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. And so the Prophet <hi>Ionas</hi> maketh his light affliction burthensome, through his owne impatiency in bearing it, and then murmureth, and euen chideth with God for his ouer much mercy in sparing <hi>Niniueh,</hi> and his too much se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerity towards him in spoyling the gourd, and causing him to bee suspected for a false Prophet. And therefore seeing Gods cheefest champions haue thus shewed their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, let vs who come so farre short of them, not dreame of hauing such a patience, as is at all times perfect and free
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:10735:79"/> from all imperfection▪ much lesse be cast downe and vtterly discouraged, when in the time of trial we bewray our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, growing into rage and impatiency, because wee faile in the degree of our patience: but let vs onely desire earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and diligently labour after this height of perfection, and when we come short of it, bewaile our imperfection. And forasmuch, as we haue not this patience of our selues, but it is the gift of God, the fountaine of all goodnesse, let vs of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten haue our recourse vnto him by feruent and effectuall prayers, laying open our miseries and afflictions, with our inability to beare and suffer them; and crauing that hee will strengthen and encrease our patience, whereby wee may be inabled to indure all those crosses that hee is pleased to lay vpon vs, grounding our faith vpon that gracious promise,<note place="margin">Luc. 11. 13.</note> that if wee aske his holy Spirit in the name of Iesus Christ, he will giue him vnto vs. And this the Apostle admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs to put in practize, <hi>If any of you</hi> (saith he) <hi>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Which duety if we conscionably and diligently performe, it will both encrease our patience, the Lord being as ready to giue his spirituall graces, as wee to aske them; and much lessen the loade of our afflictions. For if we receiue much ease and comfort, when wee vnbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our hearts of our greefes, by laying them open before a deare friend▪ if hee will with patience, though with some wearinesse heare them, and but pity vs, though hee cannot helpe vs; then how much more ease and comfort must wee needs feele, if in our afflictions wee often powre out our soules before the Lord by feruent prayer, and vnfolde vnto him all our greefes, seeing he is neuer weary in hearing our complaints, and hath not onely more pity and compassion on vs in our distresses, then the most tender father or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ouer their beloued child; but also power sufficient to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:10735:79"/> deliuer vs out of all our afflictions, and either to lessen our burthen, or to giue vs more strength and patience to beare it with comfort, yea with thankfulnesse, chearfulnesse and ioy in the holy Ghost. And hauing thus commended our cause vnto God, let vs by a firme affiance relie our selues wholie vpon his prouidence and promised assistance, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther must we for the well bearing of our afflictions rest vpon our owne naturall strength and magnanimity, but labour to furnish our hearrs with that true patience, which is the gift of Gods holy spirit. Vnto which when we haue attained in some good measure, let vs not thinke that wee can now stand, fight and ouercome, by sole vertue of this grace recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, without any further helpe from God; but considering that these graces are in this life imperfect, and mingled with much infirmitie and corruption, let vs not make too bolde in resting vpon our owne strength, but relye our selues who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon Gods assistance, presuming vpon his promised aide, that we can thereby ouercome all difficulties and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 13.</note> according to the example of the Apostle, who saith that hee could doe all things through the helpe of Christ which strengthened him.</p>

And these are of two sort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; the first are certaine reasons and arguments, by which this vertue being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended vnto vs, wee may bee inflamed with a true and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:10735:80"/> loue thereof, and answerably with all feruencie of desire may vse all diligence, and bend all our strength for the obtaining of it. For as it is in vaine to prescribe the meanes of thriuing in estate, to him that contemneth riches; or to prouide the daintiest meat for him, who hauing quite lost his stomacke, will not feed vpon it; so is it to litle pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to prescribe meanes for the attaining vnto this rich treasure, or to prouide this restoratiue nourishment of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, which being fed vpon, would strengthen vs for the bearing of the greatest afflictions; if we haue no desire to be thus spiritually inriched, nor any appetite to feed on this dainty foode of our soules; seeing wee will make no vse of this meanes when wee haue them, but carelesly contemne and cast them behind our backs. The second sort of meanes are those arguments of comfort and consolation, which are the foode and nourishment of our patience, whereby it is strengthened and preserued from languishing and fainting. The former sort may be referred to these three heads, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the excellencie, vtilitie, and necessitie of this vertue; for if it be in it owne nature most excellent, vnto vs most profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and of such necessarie vse, and great &amp; vrgent conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that wee cannot possiblie bee without it; but that a mortall maime wil follow this defect; then haue wee great cause to loue it, and out of our affection to a iewell so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, to vse all good meanes that we may attaine vnto it. Now the excellencie of patience may diuersly appeare vnto vs; for first it is ennobled by the author, who is God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; for hee alone engraueth this vertue in vs by the finger of his holy spirit, as an image and liuely picture of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite patience which is in his owne most perfect nature, and a small spark of that most glorious and mighty flame; for he is oftentimes pressed with the waight and haynousnesse of our sinnes, as a <hi>cart is pressed which is full of sheaues,</hi> as the<note place="margin">Amos. 2 13.</note> Prophet speaketh, and yet he beareth with vs; he is content through his infinite patience to suffer all those wrongs and<note place="margin">2.

                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:10735:80"/> yea hee not onely beareth with his owne seruants which loue him, but also with the wicked which are his enemies,<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 22.</note>
                  <hi>suffering with long patience the vessels of wrath, prepared to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,</hi> not presently punishing their outragious sins and high treasons against his maiesty, but deferring it to the end of the world, &amp; therefore needs must this grace be excellent<note place="margin">Est nobis cū Deo virtus ista com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munis. Inde pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientia incipit, inde claritas eius et dignitas, caput sumit. ex Cypriā. lib. de bono pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</note> which we not only haue from God, but also communicate w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> him.

To this purpose one saith; perhaps some euil doth lye vpō thee, but if y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> wilt, though it be euil in it selfe, it shal not be euil vnto thee giue thāks vnto God for it, &amp; thy euill shall bee turned into good. And hereof it is, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> if a Christian be armed w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> patience,<note place="margin">Quemeun{que} for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem videris mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serum neges.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:10735:82"/> whereas afflictions in their owne nature doe make vs to flee from God, as from the face of a terrible iudge, by our pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent bearing of them we approach neerer vnto him, as vnto a gratious Father, who correcteth vs for our good, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth these slight and momentany affliction, to helpe vs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the obtaining of that superexcellent and eternall waight of glory.</p>
               <p>The second argument to commend patience vnto vs, is<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 2. Of the vtility &amp; profit of patiēce. Cyprian de bono patientia Serm. 3.</hi>
                  </note> the great vtility and profit which it bringeth to those that haue it, for it serueth for all good vses, and furthereth vs in all our vertuous indeuours; And (as one saith) it both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth vs vnto God, and preserueth vs through his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and protection; it tempereth anger, brideleth the tongue, gouerneth the mind, keepeth peace, ruleth and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derateth discipline, &amp; breaketh the violence of lust; it asswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the swelling of pride, extinguisheth the fire of displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and vnkindnes, restraineth the power of the rich, and cherisheth the penury of the poore, &amp;c It maketh men hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in prosperity, couragious in aduersity, meeke towards those who offer iniuries and contumelies; it teacheth vs quickly to forgiue others offending vs, but if our selues bee faulty, to be long and instant in crauing pardon; it repelleth tentations, indureth persecutions, and bringeth our suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and martyrdome to perfection. It is patience which layeth a firme foundation for our faith, and aduanceth on high the progresse of our hope; it directeth our actions that we may hold on in the way of Christ, whilest we follow him in his sufferings and makes vs to continue the sons of God, whilest we imitate the patience of our heauenly father. More especially this vertue of patience is very profitable vnto vs, both in respect of God and of our selues. For it tendeth much to the aduancement of Gods glory, as it is a meanes to manifest not onely it selfe, but also the rest of Gods sauing graces to the praise of him that gaue them, whilest it ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth vs to beare all manner of afflictions and calamities for his sake; for as the excellency of the worke or gift doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:10735:82"/> commend the workeman or giuer; so these graces of patience, faith, hope, loue and the rest, beeing the gifts of God and fruits of his holy spirit, doe magnifie the power, mercy, and bounty of the Lord, when they are made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by our sufferings, and this Christian armour of proofe doth much commend the skill of the workeman, when it beats backe these fiery bullets of the worlds tentations; as it may appeare in the example of <hi>Iob, Dauid, Daniel,</hi> and the three children, and the Apostles of our Sauiour Christ, who were in all things ready to submit themselues to the good pleasure of their Lord and master, and to testifie their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and desire to glorifie him, euen vnto the death. So also it is very profitable vnto vs in respect of our selues: for first this patience doth lighten all our crosses, and lessen our paines; and that in a twofold respect: first as it doth streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then<note place="margin">Cedamus; leue fit quod bene fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur onus. Ouid.</note> and inable vs to beare all miseries and calamities, in which respect it may truely bee said that there is no bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of affliction so heauy, which may not easily and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably bee borne vpon the shoulders of patience. And in this regard one saith, that patience is an impenetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble shield, and impregnable tower repelling all manner of euill; and as a sparke falling into the deep sea, doth not at all hurt it, but is it selfe extinguished; so the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test euils which can happen, meeting with a patient mind, are themselues quelled and quenched, and doe not at<note place="margin">Chrysost. in 1. Cor 13. homil. 33.</note> all amate it, because the strength of patience is able to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all troubles and afflictions. Whereas contrariwise when men through impatiencie doe struggle and striue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their crosses and calamities, they are, like the bird in the lime-bush, or fish in the net, the more intangled; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caught, are the more disabled to beare them, or to indure the brunt of their sharpe e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>counter; for as this faintnes and weaknes of mind doth disable them, so as they cannot im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their strength to their best aduantage, but at the first onset be take themselues to flight; so doth it adde much
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:10735:83"/> strength and courage to their enemies, when as they pursue flying and fainting forces, hauing now no need to fight, but onely to follow, kill, and sease vpon the pray; whereas it would much stay the violence, and pull downe the daring pride of these spiritual enemies, if they would manfully keep their stāding, or being at y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> first somwhat disordered, would with vndaunted courage recollect the scattered forces of their minds, and againe make head against them. Neither in truth haue these afflictions any force and strength to foyle or ouercome vs, but what through our impatiency, feare, and cowardize we giue vnto them; for as one well saith, it is with paine, as it is with pretious stones, which take eyther an higher or deeper colour according to the foyle in which they are set, seeing it holdeth no other place, nor receaueth more strength then that, which in our estimate wee are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to giue vnto it. Secondly, this patience and meeke bearing of the crosse doth much lessen our afflictions in respect of God, who like a wise and louing Father doth commonly cease further to correct vs, when as hee seeth vs throughly humbled, and that wee beare his chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with patience and meekenes, in all things submitting our selues to his good will and pleasure, without any strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, murmuring, or repining, whereas contrariwise when being corrected for our faults we shew our selues impatient, stubborne and vnruly, striuing by all meanes lawfull and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to escape Gods hand, this moueth the Lord to as much displeasure, as the offences themselues for which wee are chastised, and causeth him to lay on vs more and sharper stripes, til by our sufferings &amp; smart we haue learned dutiful submission to our heauenly Father, which we would not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise out of our owne obedience. So that by our impatiency we shall get no greater aduantage, then the refractary and vnrulie oxe by his strugling to cast off the yoke; for the more he striueth, the faster his owner maketh it, and whereas his patient bearing of it would make it much lighter and easier,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:10735:83"/> by wrastling and strugling hee doth but gall his neck, tyre himselfe, and to his other labours getteth sore blowes and stripes for his vnrulinesse.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, patience is exceeding profitable vnto vs, as it maketh vs constant, and in all estates like vnto our selues, not varying and changing with the mutability of our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward condition, but in all alterations continuing one and the same; neither yet depending vpon externall accidents for peace and contentment, but making all conditions to serue our minds, and our mind subiect to none; and retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our owne habituall sweetnesse of ioy and comfort, though we run through (as it were) a salt sea of misery and affliction. And howsoeuer others who are tossed with the tempestuous stormes of worldly miseries are much indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered, and euery hand while are ready to make shipwracke of faith &amp; a good conscience; yet he who is endued with this vertue of patience, is like one who hath passed and escaped all these dangers, and being now entered into the hauen of rest, sitteth there secure from all stormes and tempests, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause though they rage neuer so much, yet they cannot reach him; and though these huge billowes of afflictions appearing in his sight, threaten to ouerwhelme him, yet when they approach neere, their proud waues fall downe and abate their fury, and either touch him not at all, or beat vpon him as against an immoueable rocke which breaketh them, it selfe receiuing no damage. And thus doth the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian man with <hi>patience settle his heart,</hi> as the Apostle teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs, making it firme and constant against all the stormes of troubles and calamities; and thus doth hee possesse <hi>his soule with patience,</hi> as our Sauiour speaketh, keeping it<note place="margin">Luc. 21. 19.</note> safe thereby▪ as in an impregnable sort, which may well be assaulted, but neuer scaled or ouerthrowne; and though, like the bush appearing to <hi>Moses,</hi> he seemeth to bee burnt with the fire of afflictions; and with the three children, to walke in the middest of this scorching furnace, yet doth hee sustaine heereby no hurt, but by the helpe of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:10735:84"/> easily ouercommeth all these difficulties and dangers. So that it fareth with men endued with this vertue, as with those who beeing of a strong constitution, continue in good plight in all ayres, and enioy their health as well on sea as on land; or as with those who hauing good stomacks, are able to disgest all meats, and to suck wholsome nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of the coursest commons; whereas contrariwise those who are enfeebled with the sicknesse of impatiency, can (like tender and weake bodies) brooke no hardnes, nor agree either with the heat of prosperity, or with the chilling cold of aduersity and affliction; neither can they well disgest the wholsomest foode which this earth can yeeld them, but through the malignity of their disposition turne that which should nourish them into poyson, and make heauy crosses of those things, which are to others their sweetest comforts. Furthermore, this vertue of patience is most profitable to defend vs against Satans tentations, and strong armour of proofe to preserue vs from being hurt by his malice and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For whereas his maine end is by these assaults of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to moue vs to leaue our standing, to murmure and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine against God, and euen to blaspheme him to his face; and when hee can in this kinde gaine ground of vs, hee will double and redouble his blowes; patience crosseth him in all these attempts; for when a man supported thereby, can with meeknesse beare all these burthens, they will bee of no force to make him disist from his good endeauoures, nor to digresse out of the right path; yea when hee can by vertue of this patience suck sweetnesse out of the gall of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and take occasion out of his crosses and troubles the more feruently and heartilie to giue God thankes, and to praise his holy name; then will it weary Satan in this fruitlesse fight, and make him willing to desist from these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, which doe but weaken himselfe, and strengthen his enemie. Finally, this patience in bearing the crosse doth much benefit vs, as it is a meanes of receiuing comfort from others; for when wee indure Gods chastizements with
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:10735:84"/> meeknes and humility, it is an effectuall argument to moue pity and compassion in the beholders, to make them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dole with vs, &amp; to afford vnto vs their best means of refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and consolation; al which helpes are so many hands, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting vs that wee may not sinke vnder the waight of our afflictions: whereas if we with impatiency do murmure and repine, curse, sweare, and shew all manner of distemper and outrage, we are liable to the iust rebukes of al that behold vs; and euery one thinketh that we are well worthy to continue still in these crosses and calamities, vntill we haue learned to beare thē better. Lastly, as this vertue of patience is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable in respect of this life, so much more in respect of the life to come. For as the Saints of old, so we now do through faith &amp; patience inherite the promises, as the Apostle spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 12.</note> and that first as it furthereth &amp; assureth vs of our salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, <hi>For he who indureth to the end shall be saued;</hi> and <hi>it is a</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 10. 22.</note>
                  <hi>righteous thing with God to recompence tribulation to thē that</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Thess. 1. 6.</note>
                  <hi>trouble his seruants, and to them that are troubled, eternall rest at the appearing of Iesus Christ.</hi> And secondly, as it maketh our crowne of glory much more glorious; for the greater our conflict is, the greater shall bee our triumph; and the more we suffer in loue and obedience to God, the more rich shall our reward bee; it being iust with God to crowne his greater gifts and graces, with a proportionable degree of glory and happinesse. But of this I shall haue occasion to speake more heereafter.</p>
               <p>The last argument to commend patience vnto vs, is the<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 3. Of the great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> Heb. 10. 36. <hi>Cyprian. de bon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But this necessity of patience will further appeare, if we consider that God enioyneth and requireth it of vs, as a
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:10735:85"/> part of that seruice which we owe vnto him. So our Sauiour Christ hauing foretolde the afflictions of the faithfull, doth will them <hi>to possesse their soules <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ith patience.</hi> And the Apostle<note place="margin">Luc. 21. 19.</note> requireth, that we <hi>be patient in tribulation;</hi> and that we <hi>run with patience the race that is set before vs;</hi> neither is it suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 12.</note> that we haue this vertue in vs in some smal measure, but we must <hi>let patience haue her perfect worke, that we our selues</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 1.</note>
                  <hi>also may be perfect and intire, lacking nothing;</hi> as the Apostle<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 4.</note>
                  <hi>Iames</hi> exhorteth vs. Nor is it enough that we be patient by fits, one while meekly bearing the hand of God, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other while storming and raging, but hauing entertained it, we must constantly continue in it; vntil we receiue the fruite of our patience, euen the saluation of our soules. For so the same Apostle exhorteth vs; <hi>to be patient to the comming of the Lord; and as the husband-man waiteth for the precious fruite</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iam. 5. 7. 8.</note>
                  <hi>of the earth, and hath long patience for it, vntill he receiue the former and the latter raine; so we must be patient and settle our hearts. seeing this comming of the Lord draweth neere.</hi> Againe the necessitie of patience wil appeare if we consider our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent state and condition in this life; for we are in a continuall warfare; and patience is a cheefe part of our armour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend vs from being pearced with the fiery darts of troubles and afflictions, without which wee lye open to their force and violence, and are indangered by their cruell blowes to be wounded euen vnto death. Our life is a race, wherein we run to obtaine the crowne of glory, and patience is a cheefe meanes to make vs well breathed, to keepe vs from fainting and tyring, and to enable vs to hold out vnto the end. It is a tedious pilgrimage, in which wee are often pulled back with the briars of troubles, and often discouraged by the fowlenesse or roughnesse of the way; the danger of those mighty enemies which lye in waite for vs, and our hard en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment which wee find in our innes; all which difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and dangers wee can no otherwise helpe, then by pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing our soules with patience, suffering with meeknesse whatsoeuer it shall please the Lord to lay vpon vs. For when
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:10735:85"/> this vertue faileth vs, then presently we are vtterly discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, faint in our iourney and sit still; or haue our hearts hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by our afflictiōs &amp; become desperate; so as we are ready to turne back againe into the world, that we may mitigate our sorrowes by enioying carnall delights and the pleasures of sinne. Whilest wee continue heere, it is of necessity that we must suffer many afflictions; for wee were preordained to be made like to the image of our Sauiour Christ, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in glory in the life to come, of which the Apostle speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing saith, that <note n="a" place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 2.</note>
                  <hi>when he shall appeare, we shall be like vnto him,</hi> but also in <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 8. 29.</note> his afflictions and sufferings in this life present, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth. And as we are predestinate, so also are wee called to suffer afflictions, as the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; where speaking of suffering wrongs patiently, he saith, that <note n="c" place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 21.</note>
                  <hi>we are hereunto called; for Christ also suffered for vs, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs an ensample that we should follow his steps.</hi> Neither is this the lot of some few alone, but of all the faithfull. For the Apostle telleth vs, that <note n="d" place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 12.</note>
                  <hi>all who will liue godly in Christ Iesus, shall suffer persecution:</hi> that <note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 12. 6. 8.</note>
                  <hi>God correcteth euery sonne whom he receiueth; and that they are bastards, and no sonnes who are not thus chastized.</hi> And this our Sauiour hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde, <note n="f" place="margin">Matth. 10. 22</note>
                  <hi>And you shall</hi> (saith he) <hi>be hated of all men for my name.</hi> And againe, <note n="g" place="margin">Ioh. 16. 2. 20</note>
                  <hi>the time shall come, that whosoeuer killeth you, will thinke that he doth God seruice:</hi> and a litle after, <hi>yee shall weepe and lament, and the world shall reioyce, &amp;c.</hi> So hee hath taught vs, that it is <note n="h" place="margin">Matth. 7. 13.</note> a narrow way and straight gate, that leadeth to heauenly happinesse, which is so difficult and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant to flesh and blood, that few will bee at the paines to find or enter into it. And the Apostle likewise telleth vs, that none shall <note n="i" place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 17.</note> raigne with Christ in his glory, who doe not participate with him in his sufferings; and that <note n="k" place="margin">Act. 14. 22.</note> by many tribulations wee must enter into the kingdome of heauen. Now from this necessitie of suffering afflictions, we may also inferre the necessitie of patience; for as this is our cheefe stay to vphold vs in all our troubles and trials; so when we want it, we presently sinke vnder their waight; for
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:10735:86"/> as the ship which hath her ballast and burthen equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed, is speedie and safe in her passage, though shee bee deepely laden; whereas contrariwise, if either through the vn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>kilfulnesse of them who fraught it, or the rage and furie of some cruell tempest, the burthen being tossed and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled from place to place, doth lye all on one side, it is easily ouerset with euery blast, and sinketh into the sea: so if the heauiest burthen of afflictions be quietly caried with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and patience, they will not hinder our passage to the hauen of rest; but if through impatiencie, frowardnesse, and murmuring, they be tossed in our hearts to and fro, we shall quickly sinke in this sea of sorrowes, yea so farre are wee from well bearing of our afflictions, without the helpe of patience, that without it, the best estate which this life yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, cannot giue vs comfort and contentment. But as weake<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and sickly bodies agree well with no aire, and are not much bettered by their often remoues and changes of place, because they cary about them their distempered hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which are the causes of their disease: so hee who is fick of impatiency and peeuish discontent, agreeth well with no condition, but picketh quarrels as well against his prosperity, as affliction, and is well (as we say) neither full nor fasting; but (like those who are sick of a feauer) bitter and sweet doe alike distaste him; loathing the very sight of wholesome nourishment, because his humour maketh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing to rellishe of his aguishe distemper. Againe, from the necessitie of afflictions, wee may conclude the necessitie of patience; seeing it is our wisest way to beare that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then with meeknesse, which wee cannot shake off; and to follow the Lord without murmuring and complaining, when he calleth vs to suffer those afflictions, vnto which he<note place="margin">Malus miles est qui imperatorē gemens sequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Senec. epist. 107.</note> hath preordained vs; for (as one saith) hee is a bad souldier who followeth his commander with grudging and repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and (as I adde) a foole too, seeing if his paines and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, which hee must vndertake vpon necessitie, were vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary and chearfull, hee might well hope after the conflict
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:10735:86"/> for praise and reward, whereas his repining seruice, is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently rewarded, if it bee pardoned. And so it were not onely faithfulnesse but wisdome in vs, to beare with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and chearfulnesse the crosses which God laieth vpon vs; seeing though we grudge and complaine neuer so much, we must beare them whether we will or no, being appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">Ducunt volentē fata, nolentem trahunt. Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes apud Senec. epist. 107.</note> thereunto; for as one saith of fate, I may truely say of Gods prouidence, that it leadeth the willing, and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing it draweth; and therefore we are put to our choice, whether wee will beare the crosse willingly and ioyfully, with praise and reward; or else whether we will or no, with repining and murmuring, hauing onely our labour for our paines, if at lest wee escape further punishment for our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiency. Finally, this vertue of patience is necessary to the well bearing of these vnauoydable afflictions, as being a notable meanes to moderate and mitigate all our greefes and sorrowes; whereas if wee be destitute of this singular grace, wee shall be as much vexed and turmoyled with our impatiencie, as with all other our afflictions, it being the nature thereof, to make light crosses heauy and intolerable, whilest it doth aggrauate them by all circumstances, and maketh them worse by a false opinion, then they are in our sense and feeling. Now what follie is this to molest and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet our selues with greefe and impatiencie, when as wee are already too much disquieted with our smart and paine? and wilfully to hurt our selues, because against our wills we are hurt by others? What is this, but to adde more to our burthen, because it is alreadie too heauie? and in childish simplicity and peeuishnesse to beat the stone vpon which we are fallen; harming our selues more with our impatien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and foolish reuenge, then the hurt it selfe would haue done, if wee had borne it patiently? If indeed sorrow and frowardnesse would lessen &amp; lighten our afflictions, though they be vnpleasant guests, there were some reason why wee should giue them entertainment; but seeing contrariwise, they much encrease the euill which we sustaine, by adding

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND thus haue I set downe such reasons and<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 1. That heathen Philosophy yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no sound comfort in the time of afflictiō.</hi>
                  </note> arguments, as doe sufficiently commend vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs patience in afflictions, that thereby our hearts may bee inflamed wiih the loue of so excellent, profitable and necessary a vertue, and to be moued with all desire and indeuour to vse al good meanes to attaine vnto it; now it followeth according to my order propounded, that I also shew those meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by this singular grace of God, may bee eyther begun where it is not, or confirmed and increased where it is. And lest we should seeke for patience where it is not to be found, and so loose our labour, wee are to know, that it is no naturall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, which hath it beginning in our beeing; no inherent quality, fortitude or constancy, which is borne and bredde with vs; for we are naturally-peeuish and impatient, froward and fretfull, complaining and crying out in the least sense of paine; and murmuring and repining against the diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, when we are neuer so little crossed of our wils. And therefore they who would find this flower of patience, must not looke for it in the barren desert of corrupted nature
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:10735:87"/> where it neuer groweth. Neyther is it to bee attained vnto by the helpe of naturall reason and Philosophy, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth vnto vs onely shadowes of comforts, that haue a seeming shew a farre off, but vanish away when wee seeke to catch them; and offereth vnto vs rotten props for the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of our patience; which being guilded ouer with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane witte, arte and eloquence, doe seeme to be of some strength, so long as our patience being vnburthened, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpright in it owne strength; but when it is tryed and pressed with the least waight of afflictions, then they faile, and (as it were) breake in fitters, bewraying their weakenes and insufficiency; together with the folly of those who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented them, and of vs who trusted in them; and like false friends they leaue and forsake vs, when needing their helpe we resort and flye vnto them. For as the heathen Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers were for the most part ignorant of the cheef causes of al afflictions; not ascribing them vnto God, and his wise and iust prouidence, but vnto fate and destiny; chance and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; not looking vnto the chiefe deseruing causes, which are our sinnes, and principally the whole corruption of our nature, the ignorance of God, and the neglect and contempt of his true worship and seruice; but imagining that all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the guidance and direction of blind fortune, which put no difference betweene the good and bad, iust and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: so accordingly they applied false remedies, and vsed medicines which were as loathsome as the disease which they sought to cure. As namely that we must beare with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience that which we cannot auoide; whereas that alone is enough to make a man breake out into al impatience, when as he considereth that his miseries which are presently into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable; are also remedilesse, and not to bee auoided for the time to come. That it becommeth not a wise man to be pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate; and that it is folly to adde to our other miseries, which are already too heauy, the waight of sorrow and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of mind, that we beare a burthen which is common to many, and that wee haue innumerable companions in our
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:10735:88"/> griefes; finally that all mankind are liable and subiect to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold miseries and afflictions, and therefore wee must not take it ill, if we be not exempted from the common lot. But in the meane time they make no mention of Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence disposing all our afflictions, and turning them to our good; they doe not shew that they are proportioned to the measure of our strength, so as they shall neuer ouerwhelme vs; nor that they are the chastisements of a gratious Father, and the fruits of his loue; nor that they are by him made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for the aduancing of our spiritual estate, the inriching of vs with heauenly graces, and the furthering of our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall saluation. Finally they put vs in no hope and assurance that God is present with vs in all our troubles, and in his good time will deliuer vs out of all our afflictions; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not to be resorted vnto by those that lye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the crosse, as being but miserable comforters, who only vtter some magnifique and glorious speeches, which haue no sound ground of reason to rest vpon; and require great matters of their Disciples; but doe not with any waight of argument arme their patience and resolution, nor inable them to performe that which is required of them.</p>
               <p>But if we would haue sound comfort in all our crosses and<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 2. That we haue by nature no true patience, but that it is Gods free gift.</hi>
                  </note> afflictions, we must seeke for it in the word of God, &amp; care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully vse those meanes which are there prescribed for the strengthening and increasing of our patience. And these may be referred to two generall heads, namely prayer, and meditation. The first and cheefe meanes of patience and comfort in all our troubles, is that wee daily haue our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course vnto God by feruent and effectuall prayer, where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n we are to craue, that by his holy spirit hee will worke in vs these gifts and graces, whereby we may bernabled to beare afflictions, for howsoeuer we seeme in the time of prosperity so constant, comfortable and couragious, that nothing can dismay vs▪ yet no sooner is the sun of worldly happines set, but presently all our comfort is cooled, and ioy quenched; and being nipped and pinched with the frost of affliction, we
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:10735:88"/> breake out into all impatiency, and passe our time in horror and despaire; for naturally we abhorre afflictions, and <hi>all cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 11.</note>
                  <hi>is for the present greeuous,</hi> as the Apostle speaketh, so that we tremble when we doe but heare of their approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching; shrinke and pull backe the shoulder when wee are called to beare the crosse, and impatiently crye out and complaine when we are but touched. Neither is this feare of afflictions a corruption onely of our natures, but a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted quality, which may be without sinne, as we may see in the example of our Saniour Christ, who earnestly desired that he might not drinke of that bitter cup of affliction, and was brought into such an agony that hee sweat water and<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 42. 43. 44.</note> blood, so as hee needed to haue an Angell sent to comfort<note place="margin">Matth. 27 46.</note> him. And when he was put to drink the dregs of this loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some potion, he was forced to cry out, <hi>my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me.</hi> The which abhorring &amp; lothing of the crosse in Christs most holy nature, was iust and lawfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ioyned with patience, obedience and conformity to Gods wil; because we are euen by the Law of nature bound to seeke our owne preseruation, and to shunne all causes and occasions which may hinder our happines, but beeing ioyned with our corruption, it becommeth vnlawfull and wicked, making vs to breake out into all impatiencie, and to murmure and repine against God. So that naturallie we haue no patience or comfort in our afflictions, but it is the free gift of God, as the Apostle implyeth whereas hee saith, that it <hi>was giuen to the Philippians to suffer for Christ,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 29. Gal. 5. 22.</note> no man can suffer as hee ought vnlesse hee receiue it of God. So elsewhere hee maketh this patience a fruit of the spirit; and affirmeth that it <hi>is God alone who doth comfort vs</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 1. 4. Rom. 15. 5. 2. Cor 1. 3. Phil. 4 13.</note>
                  <hi>in all our tribulation.</hi> And heereof it is, that this is made one of his royall titles; <hi>The God of patience and consolation; and the Father of mercies and God of all comfort.</hi> By whose power assisting vs, and spirit inabling vs, wee who can neither doe no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:10735:89"/>
               <p>In all our afflictions therefore we must haue our recourse vnto God by earnest and effectuall prayer, that wee may<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 3. Reasons mouing vs to prey when we are afflicted, first, because God then requireth vs to performe this duty.</hi>
                  </note> from him receiue this comfort and patience which we haue not of our selues; and in his good time haue helpe and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance out of all our troubles. Which duetie that wee may performe let these reasons perswade vs; First, because as the Lord doth at all times require, that we should performe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him this duty of his seruice, so more especially in the time of affliction &amp; tribulation. <hi>Call vpon me</hi> (saith he) <hi>in the day of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalm. 50. 15. Iam. 5. 13.</note>
                  <hi>trouble, so will I deliuer thee, and thou shalt glorifie me.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>is any among you afflicted? let him pray: Is any merry? let him sing Psalmes.</hi> So hauing foretold the afflictions of his Church for their iniquities, he willeth them to returne vnto the Lord their God by true repentance, and to call vpon him; and not onely requireth that they should pray, but also teacheth them a forme of inuocation. <hi>Take vnto you words</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hos. 14. 2. 3.</note> (saith he) <hi>and turne to the Lord, and say vnto him, take away all iniquity, and receiue vs gratiously; so will we render the calues of our lips.</hi> And thus our Sauiour Christ at the approaching of his owne passion, and his Disciples affliction and persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was to follow thereupon, doth inioyne them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a more speciall manner, that they should <hi>watch and pray,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 26 41. Luc. 21. 36.</note>
                  <hi>that they did not enter into tentation.</hi> And hauing foretolde the great miseries and tribulations which should follow his ascension, vpon the people of the Iewes, and all the Church before his second comming to iudgement, he doth prescribe this as a speciall and most soueraigne antidote and preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue against all these euills, that they should <hi>watch and pray continually, that so they might bee thought worthy to escape all these things which should come to passe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, wee must in our afflictions flye vnto God by<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 4. The second Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, because it is a maine end why God afflicteth vs</hi>
                  </note> prayer, because it is one especiall ende wherefore the Lord correcteth vs; for as the louing and kinde mother causeth strangers to affright her tender and dearely loued childe, when he neglecteth her, &amp; taketh delight to stray from her, that so shee may heereby preuent the danger of losing him,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:10735:89"/> and may cause him to returne vnto her for safeguard, and to cast himselfe into her armes, heereby inflaming his loue more towards her, and increasing his confidence in her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection: So doth the Lord our gratious Father cause these bugbeares of afflictions to meete and terrifie vs, when wee are straying from him, that wee may flee into his armes for helpe and succour; and suffereth vs to be depriued of other helps and comforts, that wee may with fulnesse of affiance rest wholy vpon him; wheras if either we were not at all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, or had other succours whereunto we might resort in the time of our distresse, we would not seeke vnto him at all, or at least, after a cold and loose manner. And this end the Lord expresseth, where he saith, vnto his people Israell, that <hi>Ashur</hi> should not be able to cure the wound of their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; <hi>and that he would be vnto Ephraim as a Lion, and as a Lions whelpe to the house of Iuda,</hi> rending and tearing them with afflictions and miseries, and <hi>that he would spoyle, goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and take them with him,</hi> as a pray which none should res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue,<note place="margin">Hos. 5. 14. 15.</note> and that <hi>he would goe and returne to his place,</hi> clouding from their sight the beames of his loue and fauour, <hi>till they acknowledged their fault, and sought him diligently.</hi> The which his end he attaineth vnto in all the faithfull, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the words following; <hi>In their affliction</hi> (saith he) <hi>they</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 6. 1.</note>
                  <hi>will seeke me diligently, saying, come and let vs returne vnto the Lord▪ for he hath spoiled, and he will heale vs; hee hath wounded, and he will bind vs vp.</hi> So the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> speaking of the<note place="margin">Esa. 26. 16.</note> faithfull in their afflictions, saith, <hi>O Lord in trouble haue they visited thee, they powred out a prayer when thy chastening was vpon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Gods gratious promises of hearing our prayers,<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 5. The 3. reasō takē from Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious promises of hearing vs in the time of trouble.</hi> Matth. 7. 7.</note> and granting our requests, may be an effectuall argument to mooue vs to the performance of this dutie, when we most neede his helpe, thus generally hee willeth vs to <hi>aske and it shall be giuen vs, to seeke and we shall finde, to knocke and it shall be opened vnto vs, for whosoeuer asketh, receiueth, and hee that seeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh, it shall bee opened.</hi> So

                  <hi>the father in his name he will giue it vs.</hi> And the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> telleth vs, that <hi>we haue his assurance in Iesus Christ, that if we aske any thing according to his will, he heareth vs. And if wee know that he heareth vs, whatsoeuer we aske, we know that we haue the petitions that we haue desired of him.</hi> Yea so readie is the Lord to harken vnto the suites of those that pray vnto him, that when he seeth this disposition in them, he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, that <hi>before they call, he will answere; and whilest they speak,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Esa. 65. 24.</note>
                  <hi>he will heare.</hi> But as God hath generally bound himselfe by promise to heare and helpe those that cal vpon him, so more especially such as flee vnto him by prayer in the time of their affliction; according to that of the Psalmist; <hi>call vpon me in the day of trouble, so will I deliuer thee, and thou shalt glorifie</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 50. 15. &amp; 91. 15. Psal. 145. 19.</note>
                  <hi>me.</hi> And againe, speaking of those that loue God, hee saith, <hi>He shall call vpon me, and I will heare him, I will be with him in trouble, I will deliuer him, and glorifie him.</hi> And else where; <hi>he will fulfill the desire of them that feare him; he also will heare their cry, and will saue them.</hi> And this promise the Lord doth specially fit to his Church and chosen people; namely, that if for their sinnes they were led into captiuitie by their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,<note place="margin">Deut. 4. 29. 30 31.</note> and if from the land of their captiuitie they would seeke the Lord their God, they should find him, if they did seeke him with all their heart, and with all their soule, &amp;c. And particularly it is applied to <hi>Iob</hi> by one of his friends; <hi>If</hi> (saith he) <hi>thou wilt early seeke vnto God, and pray to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob. 8. 5. 6</note>
                  <hi>if thou be pure and vpright, then surely he will awake vp vnto thee, and he will make the habitation of thy righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse prosperous.</hi> And these are the promises which are made vnto those who call vpon God in the time of their trouble; which who so applieth vnto himselfe vpon the performance of this duty, shall in the day of his affliction finde singular consolation; and out of the death of sorrow and despaire, shall be raised to the life of true ioy and comfort. And this <hi>Dauid</hi> found in his owne experience, where speaking of<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 50.</note> these gracious promises, he saith, that <hi>they are his comfort in
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:10735:90"/> trouble, and that he is by them quickned,</hi> and as it were, resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to life againe.<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 6.

               <p>Fourthly, wee must in the time of our affliction haue our recourse vnto the Lord by prayer, because he is our sole Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour and deliuerer; for if euery man out of reason and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion will resort vnto those, in their troubles and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, of whose loue and power they are most assured; yea if the bruite creatures by instinct of nature will flee thether in their extremities, where their cheefe refuge is; then by the same reason ought we in all our tribulation and calamities to flee vnto the Lord for helpe and deliuerance, seeing his loue is matchlesse, and his power infinite. For hee is our cheefe <hi>strength, our rock, our fortresse, and deliuerer; he is our</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Psal. 48. 3.</note>
                  <hi>for a sure refuge. It is he that deliuereth vs out of al our aduersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and tribulations,</hi> as holy <hi>Samuel</hi> affirmeth; he <hi>is good, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam. 10. 19.</note>
                  <hi>as a strong hold in the day of trouble, and he knoweth them that</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nahum. 1. 7.</note>
                  <hi>trust in him,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Nahum</hi> teacheth vs. Hee is our king that protecteth vs, our father that taketh care for vs, our husband and head, who loueth vs as his spouse and members; and therefore to whom should wee his subiects, children and spouses, resort to flee in the time of our dangers and distresse, but vnto this our powerfull and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious king; our carefull father and louing husband? Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally considering that as the Lord is our cheefe hope and helpe, from whom wee may expect deliuerance from affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, or patience to beare them; so he hath appointed prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as the onely meanes for the obtaining of these benefits; for as the louing and wise parent hath in himselfe a disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to bestow all things needfull vpon his deare child, and sometime to pardon his fault when hee hath offended him, and sometime to content himselfe with the taking of lesse
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:10735:91"/> correction on him then it deserueth; yet doth hee expect that his sonne in all dutie and humilitie, should intreate these fauours from him; and will neither bestow his gifts before hee sue vnto him for them; nor pardon the offence committed, before hee humble himselfe, acknowledge his fault, and craue pardon; nor yet ceaseth willingly from lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on stripes when hee hath begun to chastize him, till hee haue promised to amend, and desireth to be spared. Euen so our gracious and louing father is alwaies most ready to bestow his gifts and blessings, to pardon our sinnes, and to cease correcting of vs, because hee taketh no delight in our smart and paine; but yet vpon this condition, that wee sue vnto him for these fauours, and (as it were) by the hand of prayer take these benefits out of the rich treasury of his bounty and goodnesse. And this the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> implyeth, for though hee were perswaded that he should be freed out<note place="margin">Philem. 22.</note> of his imprisonment, and set at liberty, for the further seruice of God &amp; benefit of his church, yet he requireth the praiers of <hi>Philemon</hi> &amp; the rest of the Saints, as the meanes of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement.<note place="margin">Act. 12.</note> And thus also <hi>Peter</hi> was freed from his chaines, &amp; as it were drawne out of the iawes of death; but it was at the instant sute of the faithfull, as the holy Ghost noteth. So though the Lord were purposed to adde fifteene yeeres to the life of <hi>Ezechias,</hi> and to acquit him from the sentence<note place="margin">Esa. 38.</note> of death pronounced against him, yet hee doth not assure him of it till he had humbled himselfe, and powred out his soule by feruent and effectuall prayer. And therefore if in our wants, miseries and afflictions, wee would haue helpe from God, either for deliuerance or patience; let vs vse this meanes which hee hath sanctified for this purpose; and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God doth require it at our hands, let vs <hi>goe boldly vnto</hi>

                  <hi>if any of you lack wisdome</hi> (namely that special wisdome which enableth vs to beare the crosse with comfort and patience) <hi>let him aske of God, which giueth to all men liberally, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth no man, and it shall be giuen vnto him;</hi> and also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it much easeth vs of our greefe, and lighteneth our hearts of the burthen of our afflictions, when as we can lay open our grieuances before God, and powre out our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints into his boosome. For if it bee an ease to an afflicted minde, when as a man hath some speciall and deare friend, to whom he may communicate his greefes, &amp; make knowne his troubles and discontents, that at least hee may be pitied and bemoned of him, though he haue no power or abilitie to releeue and helpe him: then how much more ease and comfort shall wee finde in laying open the causes of our greefes before God our heauenly father? who as he infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 7.

               <p>Fifthly, we must in all our troubles haue our recourse vnto
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:10735:92"/> God by prayer, because it is the most opportune, fit and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable<note place="margin">Psal. 50. 15</note> time for this holy exercise; and this may appeare, not onely because the Lord, infinite in wisdome, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what actions best sort with all times and occasions, doth more especially inioyne vs to call vpon him when wee are in trouble and affliction: but also because we are then most readie and best disposed to the performance of this reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious dutie; and that with greater efficacie and feruencie then at other times. For if euer we will poure out our soules before God by prayer, we will doe it in our misery and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie; and though we haue neglected it in the time of our peace and flourishing prosperity, yet if we haue any spark of grace in vs, we will resort vnto God, when with the rod of affliction we ar whipped vnto him; according to the saying of the Prophet, <hi>O Lord, in trouble they haue visited thee, they</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Esa. 26. 16.</note>
                  <hi>poured out a praier when thy chastening was vpon them.</hi> And howsoeuer euē Gods dearest seruāts are in the time of their health and worldly welfare, loose and slack, cold and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in their suits and supplications, rouing in their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at large, and vttering them weakly and remisly; like ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers in a large current or spacious plaine; yet are they in their afflictions and miseries most zealous and feruent, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement and almost violent in preferring their suits; and then their prayers like strong streames in narrow straights, issue from their troubled soules with vnresistable force, and admit of no stop and opposition. An example whereof we haue in the afflicted Church of Iuda, of whom it is said, that <hi>their heart cryed vnto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Sion, let</hi>

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:10735:92"/> and in holy <hi>Dauid,</hi> who in his greatest calamities and distresses, did make his most feruent and effectuall prayers, as we may see in many of his Psalmes.</p>

But if these examples seeme too high for our imitation, as being taken from the practise of such saints of God, who had attained to a great measure of excellencie and perfection; let vs set before vs the example of <hi>Manasses,</hi> who though in the time of his prosperity, he fled from God and forsooke him, committing all outragious wickednesse both against him and the whole church; yet when he <hi>was in tribulation he prayed vnto the Lord his God, and humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe greatly before the God of his Fathers, and praying vnto him</hi>

                  <hi>God was intreated of him, and heard his prayer and brought him againe to Ierusalem into his kingdome.</hi> Yea euen the heathen mariners though they were ignorant of God and his true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, yet by the very light of nature they were guided to the performance of this duty in the time of their extremitie and danger, crying euery man to his God for helpe and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance.<note place="margin">Ion. 1. 5.</note>

In respect of the person, that wee bee regenerate, sanctified, and the sonnes of God by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption and grace; that so hauing receiued the spirit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 8. 15. 26</note> we may <hi>crye in our hearts Abba, Father; for wee know not how to pray as we ought, but this spirit helpeth our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and maketh request for vs, with sighes and groanes which cannot be expressed,</hi> framing our praiers (not according to the lusts of our owne flesh, but the holy wil of God.

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:10735:94"/> our spirits grāted; for what request can God deny which his holy spirit inditeth, and maketh? or how shal we not obtaine that grace and mercy from him, which is consonant to his most iust and holy will? Besides the Lord hath bound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe by his most free promises, that hee will heare the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his faithfull and righteous sonnes and seruants, and will grant vnto them that loue and feare him all their suites and requests: so the Psalmist saith, <note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 34. 17. &amp;</note>

                  <hi>Because he hath loued me therefore will I deliuer him, I will exalt him because he hath knowne my name; hee shall call vpon me and I will heare him; I will bee with him in trouble, I will deliuer him and glorifie him.</hi> And againe hee saith, <hi>that God will</hi>

                  <hi>we know</hi> (saith he) <hi>that God heareth not sinners, but if any man bee a worshipper of God, and doth his will, him heareth he.</hi> And therefore howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Apostle attributeth much to prayer, yet all is limited to the prayer of a man who is iust and righteous; <hi>the prayer</hi> (saith he) <hi>of a righteous man auaileth much, if it be feruent.</hi> So that if we would pray in assurance of Faith to bee heard, and haue our requests granted, we must be sanctified and purged from our corruptions; and therefore these are well ioyned together by the Apostle, <note n="i" place="margin">1.

                  <hi>the sacrifice of the wicked is an abhomination to the Lord; but the prayer of the righteous is acceptable vnto him; that the Lord is farre from the wicked, but heareth the prayer of the righteous,</hi> and that <note n="m" place="margin">and 28. 9.</note>
                  <hi>he who turneth away his eare from hearing the Law, euen his prayer shall be abhominable.</hi> So the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> telleth the Iewes, that there was in God no want of loue to heare their prayers, nor want of power, to effect their desires: but the onely let and impediment was their sinnes, which like a wall of separation, or thicke and impenetrable cloud, did hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their prayers from ascending vnto God, and his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings and benefits from descending vnto them. <note n="n" place="margin">Esa. 59. 1. 2.

                  <hi>Let as many as call vpon the name of the Lord, depart from iniquity.</hi> For as the Psalmist teacheth vs, the Lord imputeth it as great Presumption to the wicked, that they take <note n="s" place="margin">Psal. 50. 16.</note> his holy ordinances into their mouths, &amp; he hateth the very sacrifices of praier and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing which are offered vnto him by impure hands, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallowed lips. There is no man in his right wits would come as a sUiter vnto his Prince, and bring his accuser with him, who is ready to testifie and proue to his face his treason and rebellion; much lesse would any present himselfe before so great and powerful a maiesty, to make petition for some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit after he had killed and murthered his Soueraignes only sonne and heyre, hauing stil in his hand the weapon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hee committed this wicked act, imbrued and defiled with his bloud: There is no adulteresse so shamelesly impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, who would desire pardon of her iealous husband, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing still her louer in her armes, with whom shee hath often committed filthines in times past, and is resolued againe to commit it for the time to come: or if any be so mad to make such suits in this odious manner, they are sure to be repulsed, and to find wrath and vengeance, where they look for grace and mercy: but thus doe they behaue themselues towards God, who remaining polluted with their sinnes doe offer vp their prayers vnto him; for they bring their accusers, euen their defiled consciences and crying sinnes, which continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally accuse and condemne them, and call for that due iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and punishment which they haue deserued: they bring the weapon into Gods presEnce, (euen their sinnes) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they haue crucified and slaine the onely Sonne of God; and they present themselues into Gods presence to sue for grace; imbracing still with ardent loue and affection the world and worldly vanities, with whom they haue often committed spirituall whoredome, with a purpose to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue still in their former vncleannesse; and therefore let not such fondly imagine that the Lord will heare them, and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:10735:95"/> grant their suites, but rather expect that in his terrible wrath he will take vengeance on them, and turne their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porarie afflictions, into hellish torments and euerlasting punishments.</p>
               <p>Yea (will some say) but this is but small comfort to those<note place="margin">Sect. 2. That being in our selues sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, we are made righteous by faith in Christ, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the corruption of sin by repentance, and so are heard of God when we pray vnto him.</note> who are in affliction, to heare that God onely regardeth the prayers of the righteous, and that he heareth not the prayers of thē who come vnto him in their sins; for who is righteous, and sinneth not daily? And what other cause is there of our afflictions, but our sinnes, which God in his iustice cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth and punisheth? To which I answere, that howsoeuer we are all naturally defiled with originall corruption, and haue the reliques of sinne remaining in vs, euen to the day of our dissolution; and though wee continually adde heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto innumerable actuall transgressions; yet wee may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare righteous before God, and bee as cleane purged from all sinne, as if wee had neuer fallen into it; as first when wee lay holde vpon Christ by a true and liuely faith, and doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply vnto vs his obedience and merits; for then our vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse is couered with the rich roab of his perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, and our corruptions are washed and cleansed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in his most precious bloud, whereby it commeth to<note place="margin">Esa. 1. 18.</note> passe, that <hi>though our sinnes were as crimson, they shall be made as white as snow; and though they were as red as scarlet▪ they shal be white as wooll,</hi> as the Lord hath promised. And this is the purging of iustification, whereby God in Christ doth freely forgiue al our sins, and reputeth vs as iust and righteous. But besides this, there is also a purging away of our sin and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption by sanctification, when by vertue of Gods spirit &amp; a liuely faith, we are made partakers of the power of Christs death, which mortifieth the flesh &amp; the lusts thereof, and the power of his resurrection, whereby wee are raised to holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and newnesse of life. And hereof it commeth to passe, that though sinne dwell in vs, yet it doth not raigne in vs; though some reliques thereof remaine in vs, yet wee are not reputed sinners before God; not onely because we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:10735:96"/> the grace of iustification, and so haue all our sinnes forgiuen, and are clothed with the perfect righteousnesse of Christ, applyed vnto vs by a liuely faith; but also the grace of sanctification, whereby the power of sinne is abated in vs, and all our corruptions, partly mortified, and partly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to mortification, and shall at last bee fully abolished. And therefore seeing our sinnes haue receiued a mortall wound, and still languishe vnto death, we cannot properlie be called sinners, seeing it is dead to vs, and wee to it; but iust and righteous, because righteousnesse and holinesse is begunne in vs by vertue of Gods spirit, regenerating and sanctifying vs, and shall daily grow and encrease, vntill it come to full perfection; neither can sinne bee said to liue in vs, being appointed to death and finall abolishment; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be crucified and destroied, euen as wee commonly say of a condemned person, that he is but a dead man, when as hee is condemned and deputed to death, though hee be not as yet brought forth to execution. And in these respects and no other were the saints of God in the Scriptures, called righteous and iust, and had all the gracious promises of the Gospel applyed and made good vnto them; not that they were free from sinne, for there is no <hi>man righteous that doth</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccles. 8. 22. Iam. 3. 2.</note>

And therefore if we be indued with this liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith, and labour in the practise of sanctification, then shall not wee be reputed sinners, but be accepted as iust and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:10735:96"/> righteous in Gods sight; and consequently haue full right and interest vnto all Gods gracious promises; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to those which assure vs of deliuerance out of all our afflictions, or of strength and patience to beare them with ioy and comfort.</p>
               <p>But yet it is not enough that we be perswaded of our iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification<note place="margin">Sect. 3. That we must shew our faith by our repentāce and our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance by the fruits thereof.</note> by Christs righteousnesse applyed by faith, and of our sanctification by his holy spirit, vnlesse we approue them both to our selues and others, by the fruits of vnfained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, whereby (as it were by sense and motion) this spirituall life is made knowen to the glory of God and our owne comfort; and vnto this God requireth that we should not onely in generall bewaile and forsake all our sinnes; but especially and principally, those which we thinke to be the causes and occasions of our present crosses and afflictions; and then when the causes of our calamities and tribulation are taken away, these miserable effects also shall soone cease and be remoued. And if wee thus draw neere vnto<note place="margin">Iam 4. 8.</note> God by vnfained repentance, hee will also draw neere vnto vs heare our prayers and deliuer vs out of all our afflicitons; if we will cleanse our hands, and purge our hearts, and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and weepe because of our sinnes, turne our laughter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mourning▪ and our ioy into heauinesse, and humble our selues before the Lord, hee will lift vs vp, as the Apostle<note place="margin">Psal. 34. 18</note> speaketh. <hi>For the Lord is neere vnto them that are of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite</hi>

Concerning the confession of our sinnes, whereby wee lay them open before the Lord, wee are encouraged thereunto by Gods most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promises; namely, that <hi>if wee confesse and forsake our</hi>

But then</hi> (saith hee) <hi>I acknowledged my sinne vnto thee, neither hid I mine iniquitie: for I thought I will confesse against my selfe my wickednesse vnto the Lord, and thou forgauest the punishment of my sinne.</hi> And of this we haue innumerable examples in the Scriptures. As in the Israelites, who being afflicted for their sinnes do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually after their repentance, make their humble confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their wickednesse, as an introduction vnto their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for helpe and deliuerance, as wee commonly read in the history of the Iudges and the Kings. Thus also in the time of their captiuity, they cry out vnto God; <hi>We haue sinned, we</hi>

                  <hi>haue rebelled, therefore thou hast not spared.</hi> So <hi>Iob</hi> in the time of his affliction, maketh the like confession vnto God; <hi>I haue</hi>

                  <hi>sinned</hi> (saith he) <hi>what shall I doe vnto thee, O thou preseruer of men?</hi> And <hi>Dauid</hi> likewise, as appeareth throughout the whole booke of the Psalmes.

How much rather therefore should we lay open our sinnes before our heauenly father, who is ready to forget them, when we remember them; to hide them, when we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer them; and to forgiue them, when we confesse them? For hee is our spirituall Chyrurgeon and Physition of our soules, and therefore to whom should wee lay open our fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered sores of sinne, but vnto him, who by applying that so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne falue of his mercy, and the precious balme of Christs bloud is able to heale them?

Concerning the matter of our
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:10735:99"/> prayers; we are first and principally to desire the pardon and remission of our sinnes; for they are the wall of separation (as I haue said) which hinder all our suits from ascending &amp; entring into Gods eares, and his blessings from descending vnto vs; they are the poysonous sting of all our afflictions, which being pulled out, they become harmlesse, yea benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and profitable for the aduancing of our spirituall good, and the furthering of our saluation. They are the causes of all our crosses &amp; calamities, which being taken away, eyther our afflictions shall haue an end, or of crosses be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to comforts; and of noysome euils, become ioyful blessings. Whereas contrariwise if our sinnes remaine vnpardoned, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen our freedome from our afflictions, is but a bondage, Gods sparing of vs, a greeuous punishment; and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test misery, to bee freed from misery; seeing wee are left of God as a desperate cure, because the Physicke of affliction will doe vs no good, and giuen vp vnto the hardnesse of our owne hearts, to run on in our wicked courses which lead to destruction, without checke and controlement. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is that the faithful being in affliction obserue this vsuall method in their prayers, first to acknowledge their sinnes, and then to craue pardon for them, and deliuerance from their crosses and calamities. So <hi>Daniel</hi> in that excellent pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er<note place="margin">Dan. 9.</note> which he maketh for Gods afflicted Church and people, maketh first an humble confession of their sinnes, and then prayeth for mercy and the turning away of Gods wrath, &amp; for their deliuerance and restoring out of the land of their<note place="margin">Psal. 6. 1. 2. 4.</note> captiuity. And <hi>Dauid</hi> ioyneth these together praying first for the appeasing of Gods wrath and anger▪ and for mercie in regard of his sinnes, and then desireth to bee healed, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered and saued out of his affliction and tribulation.

And this naturall appetite of shunning euill, and seeking our owne good, is further warranted by Gods expresse commandement, enioyning vs in the time of our<note place="margin">Psal. 50. 15</note> afflictions to call vpon him for helpe and deliuerance. Vnto which we may adde the example of the Saints from time to time, who haue prayed against these crosses and calamities when they saw them approaching; and for deliuerance out of them after they were inflicted; which is so common and vsuall in the Scriptures, that it is but lost labour to produce examples; only that example of our Sauiour Christ aboue al exception is sufficient in it selfe; who as hee vsed all good meanes to preserue himselfe from affliction and persecution; so he earnestly prayed vnto his father, that the bitter cup of his passion might passe from him. But howsoeuer wee may lawfully pray against afflictions before they come, or for deliuerance out of them when they are inflicted; yet not absolutely and without any condition or exception; for thus onely wee must pray against sinne which is simply euill, and in it owne nature, without any respect of good; and for spirituall graces and eternall life and happinesse which are simply good, and haue in them no respect of euill. But as temporary and earthly benefits are not simply good, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:10735:100"/> mutable and liable to our abuse, become vnto vs through our corruption, not onely vaine and vnprofitable, but also hurtfull and pernicious; so these momentanie cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and afflictions, are no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> simply and absolutely euill, but through the infinite wisdome, goodnesse and power of God, disposing and ordering them, become to the faithfull exceeding good and profitable (as we shall afterwards shew at large) and that both for the manifesting and aduancing of Gods glory, and the furthering and assuring of our salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And therefore wee must not simply pray against them, because so wee should pray against Gods glory and our owne euerlasting good, but onely so farre forth as they tend to the hurt or hindrance of either of them. Againe the promises of God, which in all our prayers are the onely ground and foundation of our faith, are not in respect ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of temporary and worldly benefits, or deliuerance from these momentany crosses and afflictions, absolute and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out limitation; but alwaies restrained to the condition of his owne glory, and our spirituall good and eternall salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore in all our prayers, this condition is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be expressed or vnderstood, because wee are no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise to aske it then he hath promised it. Neither were it in truth a benefit to receiue freedome from our misery and tribulation, when as it will not stand with the glory of God &amp; our owne saluation, but rather an exceeding great iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and punishment; and consequently it should rather be a terrible threatning, then a comfortable promise, if the Lord should tel vs that he would thus deliuer vs. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doth not promise vs all things which wee desire, nor to deliuer vs from all things which wee abhorre and feare, for this were the part of an indulgent and cockering parent, who desireth to please his childe in his foolish wantonnesse for the present, rather then to seek his profit &amp; good for euer after; but rather like a wise, discreet, and truely louing father he promiseth, that if we feare and seeke vnto him, nothing shall be wanting vnto vs which is good; and that either he<note place="margin">Psal. 34. 10.

                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:10735:101"/> will not afflict vs at all, or else that he will by his power and wisdome conuert all our crosses and calamities, to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and benefit. And as the learned and faithfull Physitian, or skilfull Surgeon, doe not promise their patients which are full of corrupt humours, or indangered with old and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered sores, that they will not distaste their appetite, or any way molest and trouble them; but only that they will effect the cure, and to this purpose vse both the best and easiest meanes and medicines which they can; and as the wise pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is well satisfied with this promise, being contented rather to suffer for the present a litle smart and paine, then to hazard his life by neglect of the meanes, or to haue his sore turne to a fistul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

So the Lord doth not promise, that he will not at all afflict vs, but that our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions shall not hurt vs; not that wee shall feele no smart or paine, but that he wil cure and saue vs by the best meanes which will stand with his owne glory and our good. And therefore like wise patients we are to desire, not that he will please our appetites, but that hee will effect a perfect cure, not that he wil at our pleasure pul off the corrasiue or work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing salue of affliction and tribulation, but when it hath drawne out the core of our corruptions, and made vs fit for the healing playsters of his mercies and gracious benefits. For otherwise if wee would enlarge Gods promises accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our owne lusts and foolish fantasies, and desire that which is pleasing to our carnall appetits, and not that which is good and profitable; our carefull father will not harken vnto vs. And if in the frensie fit of our distempered passion, we either desire things hurtfull for vs (as it were cold water in a burning feauer) or would haue the vnpleasing plaisters of tribulation remoued, or the bitter potion of affliction taken from vs, which our wise Physitian hath appointed for the effecting of the cure; he will not regard our suits, seeing he desireth rather to cure vs, then to please vs; and regardeth our well grounded request, which out of a setled and sound iudgment wee made vnto him, namely, that he would vse
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:10735:101"/> the best meanes for the purging of our corruptions, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery of our spirituall health, and the euerlasting saluation of our soules; rather then a new motion arising from our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent sense; whereby in a rauing maner we prefer our bodies, before our soules; and freedome from present and momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanie smart and paine, before deliuerance from neuer end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing torments, and our euerlasting saluation in the life to come. And therefore, if we would haue our prayers heard in our afflictions, wee must pray for that which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised; not absolutely that crosses may not befall vs, or that being inflicted we may bee deliuered out of them; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally, if this our suite will stand with Gods glory and our saluation; not that they may not happen, but that they may not hurt vs; not that wee may be quite exempted from sense of paine; for this perhaps would hinder the cure, and cause vs to rot in our corruptions; but that like a wise, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and pitifull Physitian, he will handle vs as gently as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly he may, so as in the meane time the medicines vsed may bee effectuall for the purging of our corruptions, and recouery of our health. For thus (as one saith) God deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth his from tribulation, not that it may not at all befall vs, but that when it happeneth, it may not harme vs, and that<note place="margin">Deus suos libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat à tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one, non quidem ne veniat, sed ne laedat, ne no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceat, ne tanga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For euen death it selfe, (which in it owne nature is the greatest and last of worldly miseries) will in the end seaze vpon vs; but to those whom God loueth, it shall be a sleepe, the gate of life eternall, the beginning of our cōfort and refreshing; and the very ladder whereby we ascend into the ioyes of heauen. To the same purpose another saith well, that God heard <hi>Pauls</hi> prayer, not according to his will, but so as it stood best with his spirituall wel-fare. And then inferreth, that it is not a thing much to be esteemed; to be heard according to our appetite and desire; but so as it may further our profit and benefit: for euen the Diuels themselues were heard according to their will, when they desired to enter into the heard of Swine;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:10735:102"/> and the cheefe of them had his suite granted, when as hee requested that he might tempt <hi>Iob,</hi> but it was to this ende, that <hi>Iob</hi> might be tried, and the tempter confounded, And so the Israelites were heard when they lusted after flesh; but yee know what followed, whilest the meate was in their mouthes. And therefore do not much esteeme it to be heard according to thy will; for sometime God in his anger gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth that which thou desirest; and in his mercy denyeth that which thou askest. But when thou prayest for those things which God commendeth, commandeth and promiseth in the life to come, thou maiest aske securely, and intend thy fuit with all earnestnes, that thou maiest haue it heard and granted, as being bestowed by God in his mercy, and not in his anger and displeasure. But when thou askest temporall benefits, aske them with moderation and feare, and commit the issue of thy suit wholy to him, namely that hee will giue them if they be profitable, and denye them if they bee hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; for the Physitian knoweth better then the patient what doth hurt him, and what doth helpe him.</p>

                  </note> manner how wee are to pray in the time of our afflictions; which is in part touched occasionally in the former section, where I intreated of the matter of our requests, namely, that we must not pray simply and absolutely for deliuerāce, but onely so farre forth as it will stand with Gods glory and our owne spirituall good; not that the burthen of our affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions should at our pleasure bee taken from our shoulders; but that eyther the Lord would ease vs of our load, or giue vs strength and patience to beare whatsoeuer it shall please him to lay vpon vs. And this vertue of patience and spirituall wisdome we may absolutely and without condition aske of God, both because it is absolutely good and therefore liable to no abuse, but alwaies tendeth to his glory and our saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and also because wee haue an expresse promise, that if wanting this grace we pray for it, the Lord will giue it vnto vs liberally; and withall a commandement, that wee aske it<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 5. 6.</note>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:10735:102"/> in faith &amp; wauer not; because the Lord hath absolutely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised it, and therefore will vndoubtedly bestow it. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this there are diuers other things required, which I wil breefly touch, because it is not my purpose to set downe any full treatise of prayer, but onely so much as is necessary for the doctrine of afflictions. As first that we present our selues before God with all feare and reuerence; for if wee bee thus affected when wee come into the presence of an earthly Prince, though he be but a mortall man like vnto our selues, onely because he is Gods deputy, who hath in him but some small sparks of that infinite maiesty, which is in him whom he representeth; then how much more should wee bee thus affected, when wee come into the presence of God who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords? And this reuerence and respect of his glorious presence, the Lord at all times requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of vs, as he is our Father and Master; <hi>if</hi> (saith hee) <hi>I bee a Father where is mine honour, if a master, where is my feare?</hi> but<note place="margin">Mal. 1. 6.

                  <hi>thing before God; for God is in the heauens, and thou art on the earth, therefore let thy words be few.</hi> The which argument our Sauiour prefixeth before that perfect forme of prayer, to prepare vs thereby to call vpon God with all reuerence; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee is not onely a Father, but heauenly and the full of all glory and maiesty. Let vs therefore in the first place pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent our selues and our prayers before God with al feare and reuerence; and to this end let vs both consider, what the Lord is before whom we come, namely, a God infinite in maiesty, glory, greatnes, power, seeing all things euen the secret corruptions of our harts, most pure, iust, holy, the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour and preseruer of all things, &amp;c. And also what we are, namely, vile, wretched, miserable, dust and ashes, wormes
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:10735:103"/> and no men, defiled with sinne, and full of all imperfections, with which considerations being humbled, wee shall be the better fitted to receiue mercy and helpe from God. For hee giueth his grace to the humble, &amp; dwelleth with those who are of a contrite spirit.<note place="margin">Esa. 57. 15. § <hi>Sect. 4.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, God requireth that we pray in truth; whereby I doe not onely vnderstand, that we must indeede desire the things we pray for, which is not necessary to be stood on in this place; because there are few hypocrites in suits of this nature, seeing all desire with all their hearts and soules to be freed out of their afflictions; but more especially that wee draw neere vnto God in the time of our trouble, not onelie<note place="margin">Esa. 29. 13.

For as it is alwaies a thing odious, to bee in our prayers distracted with wandring thoughts; and to haue our harts and minds going a roauing after worldly vanities, when our tongues and lips make our suits and petitions vnto God; so especially when wee fault after this manner in the time of our afflictions, seeing the Lord hath purposely brought vs into these straights, that we may more seriously, and with greater attention and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our minds call vpon him; and putteth (as it were) these pricks in our sides, that we may the rather be moued to keep the right way without any vaine wandring, or wanton digressions. And if wee doe not thus call vpon God in<note place="margin">Quomodo te au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diri a Deo postu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las cum te ipse non audias? vis esse deum memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem tui cum ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas, cum tu ipse memor▪ tui non sis?

Or how can wee hope that God will regard our suites which wee make vnto him, when we our selues doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them? especially considering that the Lord hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained his promise of hearing our prayers vnto those one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who doe in truth call vpon him, for as the Psalmist saith,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:10735:103"/>
                  <hi>the Lord is neere vnto all them that call vpon him; yea</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalm. 145. 18.</note>
                  <hi>to all that call vpon him in truth.</hi> As therefore in the time of the Law, when for their sinnes they were to offer vp vnto God whole burnt offerings, it was not enough, that they offered vp the outward parts alone, but they must also burne the very <note n="a" place="margin">Leuit. 1. 13.</note> intrailes and bowels: so when in the time of our tribulation wee offer vp this sacrifice of prayer, let vs as well lift vp our <note n="b" place="margin">Psalm. 25. 1.</note> hearts and soules, as our hands and eyes; and pray as wel with the mind <note n="c" place="margin">1. Cor. 14. 15.</note> and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, as with the tongue and voice; or else wee shall heare that iust censure, that we worship God in vaine, and haue no assurance that hee will heare our prayers.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, wee must pray in faith, whereby wee are to<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 5. The 3. thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired is that we pray in faith.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">1. Iohn. 5. 14. Psalm. 50. 15. &amp; 91. 15. &amp; 103. 8. 9. Iob. 5. 18. 19.</note>
                  <hi>wee call vpon him in the time of our trouble, hee will deliuer vs, that wee may glorifie him.</hi> That hee will bee with vs in trouble, heare, deliuer and glorifie vs, and finally that hee will not alwaies chide nor keepe his anger for euer, as the Psalmist telleth vs. And this speciall faith thus grounded on Gods promises, is most necessary vnto our prayers in the time of affliction, because the Lord by his holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle doth require it; for hauing willed vs, that if wee lacke Wisedome wee aske it of God, who giueth vnto all men liberally; hee biddeth vs to <hi>aske in faith and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer</hi>

And this earnestnes in prayer the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> vsed in his afflictions, euen thirsting (as hee saith) after Gods mercy for the granting of his suites, like the thirstie land, which being chopt with drought, seemeth to gape conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually after raine, neuer shutting the iawes till it bee filled and satisfied. Thus also the disciples being endangered by a<note place="margin">Psal. 143. 6. Matth. 8. 25.

And thus our Sauiour Christ himselfe in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> time of his greatest affliction, sheweth also his greatest fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencie in prayer, praying more often and instantly then at other times; for he is said to haue prayed thrice, that the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cup of his passion might passe from him; and being in his<note place="margin">Heb. 5. 7.</note> agony to haue prayed more earnestly, and to haue vttered his prayers and supplications with strong crying and teares vnto him that was able to saue him from death. Yea not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the faithfull, but euen the Heathenishe Nineuits, who in<note place="margin">Ion. 3. 8.</note> the time of their prosperitie were so carelesse and secure, that they had need to be awakened with that heauie denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of their destruction; when they were brought into these narrow straights, are said to haue cryed mightily vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for deliuerance out of that danger. So that if wee would not be vnlike all Gods Saints and seruants, yea if we would not come behind the Nineuits themselues, wee must in the time of our afflictions, not onely pray vnto God, but performe this dutie with great feruencie and earnestnesse. For indeed, this is a cheefe end why the Lord afflicteth vs, and why also he differreth to deliuer vs at the first motion, because hee would haue vs more vrgent and instant in our<note place="margin">Luk. 11. 7. 8.</note> prayer; as our Sauiour Christ plainly sheweth vs in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the two friends, the one awakening and raising vp the other to supplie his wants by his importunitie; and of the vnrighteous Iudge, who by the poore widowes inces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant suing and troubling him, was in the end moued to doe<note place="margin">Luk. 18. 5.</note> her iustice. An example whereof we haue in the Canaanitish woman, who receiued from our Sauiour many repulses, not that hee was vnwilling to hearken vnto her, and granther petition; but because hee would giue her occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion<note place="margin">Matth. 15.</note> to shew her faith and feruencie in following her suite. Vnto which seruencie, if wee doe not attaine in the time of our afflictions wee cannot hope to haue our requests heard
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:10735:105"/> and regarded, for if wee be slacke, colde, and negligent in offering our suites vnto God, the Lord will bee flacke and slowe in granting them; and if through our slouthfulnesse we frustrate Gods end in afflicting vs, hee will also fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the end of our prayers, and will not heare nor deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs out of our afflictions. For although he hath made many gracious promises, that hee will heare and helpe vs, when wee call vpon him in the time of our trouble, yet they are restrained vnto this condition, if our prayers bee feruent and effectuall. So hee promiseth the Israelites, that if being in tribulation, in the land of their captiuity, they did from thence seeke the Lord, they should surely finde<note place="margin">Deut. 4. 29.</note> him; if they did seeke him with all their heart, and with all their soule. And the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> telleth vs, that <hi>the prayer</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iam. 5. 16.</note>
                  <hi>of a righteous man auaileth much, if it be feruent or effectuall.</hi> And therefore though wee be neuer so eloquent and ample<note place="margin">Hos. 7. 14.</note> in our prayers with our tongues and lippes, yea though out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly we howle and cry with our mouth and voice in our suits vnto God, yet the Lord will not regard them, if in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the heart and affection they be cold and negligent. Whereas contrariwise if wee poure forth our hearts before God with feruencie of spirit, then though with <hi>Moses</hi> wee say nothing at all, yet our prayers will be lowde and strong cryes to moue his attention; though with <hi>Hannah</hi> we make<note place="margin">Exod. 14. 15</note> our suits after such manner, that we only moue our lips, and haue no voice heard, and in regard heereof seeme vnto men<note place="margin">1. Sam. 1. 16.</note> drunke or distract of our wits, yet if wee poure forth our soules vnto God, hee will looke vpon our affliction and heare our prayers. Though with <hi>Hezechiah</hi> wee are notable through the violence of our affliction to vtter a perfect sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, but chatter like a Crane or Swallow, our prayers will<note place="margin">Esa. 38. 14.</note> be as effectuall to preuaile with God, if they proceed out of hearts inflamed with zeale and feruencie, as though they were vttered in the smoothest stile, and adornd with all the flowres of thetorick. Yea, if we can not speake at all, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sigh and grone, yet this beeing the language which his
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:10735:106"/> owne holy Spirit teacheth vs, wee may bee assured that he<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 26.</note> both vnderstandeth it, and will also regard and harken vnto it.</p>
               <p>The fifth thing required is humilitie, whereby acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 7. The fifth thing required, is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, whereby we submit our wills to the will of God.</hi>
                  </note> our owne blindnesse and ignorance, by which it commeth to passe, that wee know not what is good for vs, nor what to pray for, but with <hi>Zebedeus</hi> sonnes, aske wee know not what; and on the other side, the infinite wisdome of God, whereby hee knoweth what is best for vs; and his boundlesse bounty and mercy, whereby according to his most gracious and infallible promises, thee is alwaies readie to bestow vpon vs all things which are good and profitable; we doe wholy resigne vp our selues vnto his good pleasure, submit our wills which are continually subiect to errour and mistaking, vnto his most holy will, which is priuiledged from these infirmities; and wholy referre all our suits and petitions vnto his most wise consideration, to be granted or denyed, as will stand best with his glory, and the good and saluation of our owne soules. And this duty our Sauiour Christ hath taught vs in that most perfect forme of prayer, where next after the aduancing of Gods glory and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, hee willeth vs to desire, that <hi>his will may bee done in earth as it is in heauen.</hi> Which if wee obserue, conforming our will in all things to the will of God, we are sure not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to haue all our requests granted, but also in such manner and measure, as shal be most for our spirituall profit, and the furthering of Gods glory, and our owne saluation; seeing God knoweth, when and by what meanes to effect them better, then wee out of our ignorance can prescribe vnto him. Yea in truth wee can haue no assurance that any of our prayers which wee make according to our owne lusts, and not according to the will of God shall be heard or granted; vnlesse it be in Gods displeasure, for our iudgment and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment; seeing these humble prayers, which wee wholy submit to the will of God, haue the promise of being heard, made vnto them; according to that of the Psalmist, <hi>Commit

                  <hi>any thing according to his will, he heareth vs.</hi> A notable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whereof we haue in our Sauiour Christ, who though he did most earnestly desire to haue the bitter cup of his passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to passe from him, yet doth hee submit himselfe and his suite to the good pleasure of his heauenly father. <hi>O my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 26. 39</note> (saith he) <hi>if it be possible, let this cup passe from me: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> And thus we submit our selues and our suits vnto Gods will, first in regard of the substance of them, when hauing prayed for deliuerance out of our afflictions, wee can be content whether he will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs or no, leauing it wholy and freely to his choyce and pleasure, whether he will free vs from our crosses, or seeing it good for vs that wee should still lye vnder them, will giue vs strength and patience, so as wee may beare them with comfort and contentment. Secondly, when as wee doe not prescribe any meanes vnto him, whereby we would be freed from all our afflictions, but leaue it wholy to the disposing of his wise prouidence; who with these, or other meanes; yea aboue, without, and contrary to all meanes, is able through his owne omnipotent power, to effect and bring to passe whatsoeuer it pleaseth him. Thirdly, when wee doe not limit or restraine him to either time or place, but leaue it wholy vnto his good pleasure, who knoweth best when it is most seasonable for the effecting of his owne good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses; onely in generall, pray that hee will then and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore free vs out of our troubles and afflictions, when as they haue effected those good ends for which he sent thē; that is, enriched vs with his spirituall graces, and brought vs neerer vnto him by vnfained repentance. Fourthly, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our wills to the wil of God in respect of our ends, not crauing his blessings and benefits for worldlie, carnall and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:10735:107"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> respects; but that we may employ them to those vses and ends, for which hee hath bestowed them; and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally that wee may the better be enabled to glorifie God; and be furthered in the way of our owne saluation. And if wee doe not thus conforme our wills to Gods will, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding these ends to our desires, we can haue no assurance to be heard of God, or to haue our petitions granted, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it be in his wrathfull displeasure. And thus the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> telleth those hypocrits to whom hee writeth, that they <hi>asked of God, and receiued not, because they asked amisse;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iam. 4. 3</note>
                  <hi>that they might consume Gods blessings receiued vpon their owne lusts.</hi> Wherein the Lord dealeth graciously with his children and seruants, seeing the abuse of his benefits would much more hurt and endamage them, then the obtaining and hauing them would doe them good. And therefore, as the wise father doth out of meere loue denye his childe a knife, though hee earnestly beggeth it, when hee knoweth that he doth desire it to play the wanton with it, to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daungering of himselfe or others: and keepeth him bare of money, when he desireth it, that hee may spend it in riot, wantonnesse, drunkennesse, and such other wicked courses; and would not cease to giue him more stripes, if hee should perceiue by his plaine speaches, that hee therefore craued to be spared, that hee might returne to his old wayes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine incurre his displeasure, by committing wilfully his former faults: so the Lord will in loue and mercy denie to heare vs, crying vnto him for deliuerance out of our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, when our suits haue ill ends propunded vnto them, and not such as are pleasing vnto him, and agreeable to his reuealed will. For example, the end which he propoundeth of our deliuerance out of affliction is, that beeing set at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, we might thankfully remember so great a benefit, and so be moued to glorifie him by our obedience, and by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering vnto him deserued praise. Now contrariwise, if wee desire to bee freed from our afflictions, that wee may with more pleasure and delight goe forward in our old worldly
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:10735:107"/> and wicked courses, and not that wee may be the fitter for his seruice; as for example, if we desire health and strength, that we may follow our carnall pleasures, and not that wee may the better be enabled to serue God in the generall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of christianity, and the speciall duties of our callings; if wee desire to be eased of our pouertie, and to be enriched, that we may match or put downe those which are either our equals or superiours, or that we may spend these blessings in gay apparell, surfetting and drunkennesse, or contrariwise, to fill vp baggs onely, that we may be counted rich, without any purpose to vse thē when we haue them; and not that we may glorifie God in his owne gifts, by our wise disposing of them for the good of our selues and others, in the works of christianitie, iustice and mercy; the Lord will not bestow these blessings vpon vs, though we begge them neuer so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly; or if hee should, they would bee curses and not bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, and signes and pledges, not of his mercy and loue, but of his wrath and heauie displeasure. And therefore if wee would be heard, when wee call vpon God for deliuerance out of our afflictions, let vs propound right ends of our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and immunitie; and because wee are forgetfull and negligent in performing those good duties, which in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> time of our troubles we propounded as the end of our deliuerāce;<note place="margin">Gen. 28. 20 1. Sam. 1. 10. 11 Psa. 66. 13. 14 &amp; 32. 1. 2.</note> therefore it were not amisse to binde our selues heereunto by holy and solemne vowes, according to the example of <hi>Iacob, Hannah, Dauid,</hi> and other of Gods Saints and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.</p>
               <p>The last thing required in our prayers, respecteth their<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 8. What is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in respect of their time and continuance, namely perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi>
                  </note> time or continuance; namely that we doe incessantly perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere in prayer without discouragement, although our suites be not presently heard and granted; and though after many prayers wee haue neither deliuerance out of our afflictions, nor any sense of comfort, or patience in bearing them. It is true, that it is a dangerous tentation for a poore Christian to cry and call for helpe in his trouble, and not to haue his suits regarded. For a man would thinke that if God would
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:10735:108"/> heare the prayers of any, then especially of those who are in<note place="margin">Psa. 50. 15. &amp; 91. 14. 15</note> affliction, seeing they aboue others haue his speciall promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises; that if hee would heare at any time, then after much crying and calling; and if in any thing, then in this suite for mercy and deliuerance which himselfe hath commanded vs to make, with a promise to heare vs; but for a man to pray, yea an afflicted man to pray; and for such an one to pray of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and to pray thus with <hi>Dauid</hi> out of the depthes of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, and that with all feruencie and earnestnesse, and yet not haue his prayers heard, nor his suites granted; this stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth at the roote of faith, and shaketh the very foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if it be not built strongly vpon the rocke. For then wee are ready to despaire of helpe, and to conclude, that seeing we haue found our prayers vaine and bootelesse; therefore we will saue that labour, and not spend our strength to no purpose, But the more strong and dangerous this tentation is, the more carefully ought euery Christian to arme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe against it. And to this purpose let vs consider, that the Lord requireth not onely that wee should make our suites known vnto him once or twice, or some few or many times, but that we incessantly continue in prayer, and neuer giue ouer till wee haue our petitions heard and granted. So the Apostle willeth vs to <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 12. 12.</note>
                  <hi>reioyce in hope, to be patient in tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to continue in prayer;</hi> that <note n="b" place="margin">1. Thes. 5. 17</note>
                  <hi>we pray continually;</hi> and <note n="c" place="margin">Ephe. 6. 18.</note>
                  <hi>alwaies, with all manner of prayer &amp; supplication in the spirit, &amp; watch thereunto with all perseuerance,</hi> and finally, that we <note n="d" place="margin">Col. 4. 2.</note>
                  <hi>continue in prayer, and watch thereunto with thanksgiuing.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luc. 18. 2. 3 Chap. 11. 6. 7</note> Yea thus are wee bound to pray, when there is after much supplication no helpe appearing, no sense of comfort for the present, nor any outward ground of hope for the time to come; as our Sauiour teacheth vs in the parable of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> widow, incessantly suing vnto the vnrighteous Iudge; and of the importunate friend, who would admit of no answere till his suite was granted; for to this very end the Lord purposely differreth to helpe vs, though euen at the first call he ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in the bowels of his compassion towards vs, that hee
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:10735:108"/> may hereby try, and by trying, exercise; and by exercising, encrease our faith, hope and affiance in him; as also that wee may be moued more seriously to repent of our sinnes, and with more feruencie and earnestnesse to call vpon him. And therfore when the Lord seemeth to slacken his pace in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to deliuer vs, we must not slacken ours too in going vnto him, but with more diligence and speed we must runne and meete him, and with the greater importunitie desire him to hasten his helpe. An example of which perseuering in prayer wee haue in <hi>Dauid,</hi> who neuer ceased to cry and call vpon God for mercy and deliuerance, though hee had no sense of comfort, but was much perplexed in his distressed estate. <hi>In the day of trouble</hi> (saith he) <hi>I sought the Lord. My</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 77. 3.</note>
                  <hi>sore ran and ceased not in the night, my soule refused comfort. I did think vpon God, and was troubled; I prayed, and my spirit</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 15.</note>
                  <hi>was full of anguish.</hi> So in the woman of Canaan, who being patient of all repulses, continued her earnest suite, &amp; would take no denyall. And thus though the afflicted Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth, that the Lord <hi>had couered them with wrath, persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, slaine, and not spared them; and that when they were in this</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lam. 3. 43. 44 50.</note>
                  <hi>distresse; he had couered himselfe with a cloude, that their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>

                  <hi>could not passe through;</hi> yet shee continueth her suites and petitions vnto God, till he looked downe from heauen, and sent them helpe and deliuerance out of all their miseries and afflictions. Which examples if we likewise will follow, we shall assuredly haue the like issue and successe in our prayers and supplications; for this gracious promise &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is common to all the faithfull, that if <hi>they cry, the Lord heareth them, and deliuereth them out of all their troubles.</hi> And though he hath giuen them no assurance that he will heare them at the first or second call, nor prescribed and limited a time or day when he will helpe and deliuer them; yet he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth vs all to <hi>goe boldly vnto the throne of grace,</hi> assuring<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 16.</note> vs that wee shall <hi>receiue mercy, and finde grace to helpe in time of neede.</hi> But of this perseuerance in faith and patience, when the Lord deferreth to heare and helpe vs, I shall haue

All which for order sake, I will reduce vnto two heads. The first are such as may serue to comfort vs in our crosses and calamities, though wee should continually lye vnder them, euen to the day of our death; the second, such as arise from the assurance which wee haue of Gods gracious and most seasonable deliuerance. The arguments and reasons of the first sort, are either spirituall, arising and springing out of the holy Scriptures; or else <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iuil and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, grounded vpon some earthly meanes, and meere morall considerations. The arguments of comfort which are spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, are either simple or comparatiue. The reasons simply to be considered doe arise either from the causes and effects, or the subiect and adiuncts of our afflictions. The causes of our afflictions to bee considered of▪ are either efficient or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; the efficient causes, are either the inflicting, or mouing causes. The principall cause inflicting all troubles and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions vpon vs is God himselfe, and that in a three fold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:10735:109"/> First, because he hath predestinated and fore-ordained vs to suffer these afflictions. Secondly, as he doth according to this his purpose execute his decree. And thirdly, as hee doth by his most wise and powerfull prouidence, order and dispose of al our crosses of calamities, with all circumstances which belōg vnto them. That the Lord hath preordained vs to suffer afflictions, the Apostle sheweth in the eighth of the Romanes, where speaking of afflictions he saith, that <hi>whom God knew before, he did also predestinate, to be made like to the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 29.</note>
                  <hi>image of his Sonne,</hi> (namely, in suffering worldly miseries, and bearing the crosse) <hi>that he might be the first borne among</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 24. 26</note>
                  <hi>many brethren;</hi> and so by suffering these things, might enter into his glory, as our Sauiour Christ himselfe speaketh. To which purpose <hi>Eliphaz</hi> also saith, that <hi>misery commeth not forth of the dust, neither doth affliction spring out of the earth;</hi>

In whom we liue, and moue, and haue our beeing; so that if he he sustaine vs we continue, but if he blow vpon vs we are presently destroyed, and returne againe vnto our dust.

Neither are we fondly to imagine that the Lord created his creatures, and then left them to the ordering and ruling either of thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, or vnto fate, chance and blinde fortune; but he doth by the same wisdome and power gouerne and dispose them according to his owne good pleasure; so that howsoeuer they oftentimes transgresse and violate his will reuealed; yet they neuer crosse or hinder his secret will and counsaile, but in all things, notwithstanding their malice and opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he maketh them serue his prouidence, directing them vnto those ends for which they were created. Nor doth the Lord onely thus rule his cheefest creatures, or those which are inferiour, at some times, or vpon some waighty occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, but this all-seeing and all-ruling prouidence of God, doth extend it selfe to the ruling and gouerning of the meanest, euen of the seelie sparrowes, yea of a worthlesse haire, so as without his direction and appointment they cannot light or fall vpon the ground, as our Sauiour spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:10735:116"/> creatures, but by the wise guidance and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their creatour; then how much lesse vnto men (the noblest peece of this worldly workmanship) who are worth many thousands of them, yea vnto his faithfull seruants and children, who exceed in his valuation many thousands of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men? and this is that argument of consolation which our Sauiour vseth to comfort his disciples, and to arme their patience against those persecutions, crosses and calamities, which should afterwards betide them for the profession of his name. <hi>Are not two sparrowes</hi> (saith hee) <hi>sould for a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and one of them shall not fall to the ground without your</hi>

For as for the causes of all afflictions, they are all subordinate vnto him who is the supreame and principall cause, and serue but as inferiour meanes and instruments to effect his will and pleasure. For the better vnderstanding wherof, we are to know; that there is in nature a concatena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:10735:116"/> inter-linking and chaining of causes together, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by inferiour causes are so subordinate one to another, as that they all holde their subordination vnto God, who is the first and principall cause; whereof it commeth to passe, that as one of them cannot worke and mooue without the helpe of the next cause vnto which it is subordinate, as for example, fruits cannot nourish vs, vnlesse the earth nourish them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the earth bring them forth, vnlesse the Sunne shine and the raine fall vpon them: so none of them can mooue or worke, but by that vertue which they receiue from God, the first and cheefe cause, whereby they are inabled to produce all their actions and operations. In regard whereof all the effects and actions of secondary causes (beeing considered simplye in themselues without their poyson and malignitie of sinne) are not so properly the effects of them, as of that cause which is first and principall. As for example wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so properly say, that our meate doth nourish vs, or clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes keepe vs warme, or that the sunne doth lighten vs, or our friends prouide for vs; as that God doth all these things by them, namely as the chiefe cause working by his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And although these effects be properly and fitly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to their next and immediate causes; yet more fitly and properly may wee say, that God doth by them nourish, warme, lighten and prouide for vs, seeing from him alone they haue all their vertue and efficacy, without which they could doe nothing. For as the Scribe is more properly saide to write, then the Pen, and he that maketh and keepeth the clocke is more properly said to make it goe and strike, then the wheeles and peyzes that hang vpon it, and euery work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to effect his worke, rather then the tooles which hee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, as his instruments: So the Lord who is the cheefe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and first mouer in all actions, may more fitly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be said to effect and to bring to passe all things which are done in the earth, then any inferiour or subordinate cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, seeing they are all but his tooles and instruments, which cannot moue of themselues, but as they are ruled and guided
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:10735:117"/> by the power and prouidence of this heauenly workeman. And thus the Lord vseth all his creatures both vnreasonable and reasonable to serue his prouidence in the afflicting and chastizing of his children. Of the former sort the examples are innumerable like vnto the huge hoast of the creatures themselues; for thus the Lord vseth the fire and water, the infection of the ayre, the barrennes of the earth, the winds and weather, raine, drought, frosts and mildeawes; the wild and bruite creatures; and that not onely the sauage beasts which excell in strength, and are armed by nature to doe hurt; but euen the selie flyes, grashoppers, cankerwormes, and caterpillers as the Lord threatneth, and the Prophet <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> sheweth.

               <p>The like also may bee saide of the reasonable creatures, which howsoeuer they may seeme at their owne will and pleasure to afflict and punish vs; yet is both their will and power so ouerruled, limitted and ouermastered, by the all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouerning power and prouidence of God, that they cannot

And thus the Lord ruleth as his instruments in o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r afflictions both Angells and men; and that both good and bad. For howsoeuer the good and holy Angels are Gods willing ministers, to watch ouer and guard the faithfull in all dangers, and his ready messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to conueigh vnto them his blessings and benefits; yet when the Lord their master and commander is pleased to vse them as his instruments in afflicting &amp; correcting them, they are prest to doe his will. Howbeit they haue their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission which they must obserue, their time appointed when to begin, and when to make an ende, and the very number and measure of their blowes that they are to giue, which they neither can nor will exceed. An example whereof wee haue in the destroying Angell smiting the Israelites with<note place="margin">2. Sam. 24.</note> the plague and pestilence; who continued the execution of Gods iudgements til the Lord restrained him, but no sooner doth the Lord c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mmād him to cease, but presently he shea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theth his sword of vengeance, and desisteth from doing any further harm. So the Lord intending to plague Ierusalem by the ministery of an Angell, first giueth commission to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Angell that he should set a marke vpon the foreheads of them that did mourne, and crye for all the abominations that were done in the middest therof; and then biddeth the destroying Angell to goe through the Citie and smite, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sparing nor pittying any, olde or yong, maids or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,<note place="margin">Ezech. 9. 4. 5. 6.</note> but with all chargeth him not so much as to touch a man, who by his marke was exempted from the common calamity and destruction. And thus the fower Angels who had power giuen them to hurt the earth and the Sea, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained from the execution of their commission, till the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants<note place="margin">Apoc. 7. 3.</note> of God were marked in their foreheads. Neither doth
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:10735:118"/> the Lord thus order and dispose by his wise and powerfull prouidence the good Angels onely, who being his seruants take their cheefe delight in doing his will; but also hee doth often vse, &amp; by the same wise prouidence dispose of, the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Angels and Diuels, as his instruments for the afflicting of his faithfull children. And when they thinke of nothing lesse then of doing his will, glorifying his name, or doing good to his Saints and seruants; but contrariwise wholy ayme at Gods dishonour and their destruction: euen then he ouerruleth them by his powerfull prouidence, &amp; maketh them (maugre their malice) to effect his will, and to serue him vnto those ends for which he imployeth them. In which respect one well saith, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> though the wil of Sathan be alwaies wicked, yet his power is neuer vniust, because hee hath his will from himselfe, but his power from God, and therefore what he vnlawfully affecteth to doe, that God will not suffer to bee done but iustly and lawfully. And this is the cause why the spirit which vexed <hi>Saul</hi> is called the euill spirit, and y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Spirit of the Lord; namely the spirit of the Lord in respect of that iust power which was granted vnto him by God; and the euill spirit in regard of the desire of his vniust and maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous will. And thus he vsed Satan in afflicting <hi>Iob</hi> for the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of his patience, that it might be crowned with the greater glory; when as the Deuill aimed at nothing lesse, but onely sought to cause <hi>Iob</hi> by these afflictions to blaspheme God vnto his face. And thus he gaue him from time to time his commission which he could not passe. And so the Lord tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Angell of the Church of the Smyrnians, that the<note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 10.</note> Deuill should cast some of them into prison; but willeth them to be of good comfort because it was not at his owne pleasure, but at Gods appointment, who foretold them of these afflictions; not as long as he list but only for ten daies, which was the time limited by God: not that hee might heereby attaine vnto his owne malitious ende, which was that they might bee destroyed, but that hee might fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and aduance Gods end, namely that beeing tryed and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:10735:118"/> found faithfull they might obtaine the crowne of life. And therefore howsoeuer there can bee nothing more terrible and fearefull then to know that Sathan who hath beene a murtherer from the beginning, and an ancient enemy of mankinde, exceeding vs so much in power, and hauing his power so much exceeded by his malice, should bee the next and immediate cause of our afflictions; yet when wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider with all, that he is but a bare instrument in the hand of God, which by his power and prouidence hee turneth and windeth at his good pleasure; and alwaies forceth him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he wil or no, to serue for the aduancing of his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, &amp; the spirituall good &amp; euerlasting saluation of his elect, there is in this meditation sufficient cause to expell all feare and horror, and matter enough of patience &amp; consolation.<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 4.

For as the wise and louing father hauing reformed his childe by correction, and made him respectiue and carefull in the performance of all god duties; doth to giue him contentment, and assurance of his loue and clemencie, vpon the continuance of his good courses, cast the worne rod which is past vse into the middest of the fire: So doth the Lord cast these wicked instruments; which are (as he calleth them) the rodds of his wrath, into the fire of destruction, when hee hath no further vse of them for the chastizement of his children, that so they may the more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely

I answere, that this serueth nothing for their excuse, nor doth any thing at all extenuate their faultinesse; for howsoeuer they in afflicting Gods seruants doe the secret will of God, which no creature in heauen or earth is able to withstand; this maketh nothing for them, seeing this hidden will was neuer propounded as a rule vnto which they should conforme their actions: but the Lord hath giuen vnto vs the knowledge of his will reuealed in his word, vnto which hee requireth conformitie and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And by this they are enioyned to loue the faithfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all others, and by all good meanes to seeke the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of their good; whereas contrariwise they doe hate them so much the more, afflicting and persecuting them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for this thing aboue all others, because they are of the houshold of faith, and of Gods owne familie; who make conscience of their waies, and will not run with them into

Neither do they at all ayme at Gods end, or euer think of effecting of his counsailes &amp; secret wil; but they only labour to effect their own malicious designes, and to accomplish their owne wills, whereby they desire to glut their crueltie, and to aduance themselues out of the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of Gods seruants. So the Lord saith, that whereas in his cret counsaile, hee sent the King of <hi>Ashur</hi> against his people<note place="margin">Esa. 10. 7. 8.</note> to afflict them for their sins, <hi>he thought of nothing lesse; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did his heart esteeme it so; but he onely imagined to destroy</hi>

                  <hi>and cut off not a few nations; that he might make all his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Kings;</hi> and so himselfe a mightie Monarch. Thus it was the will of God to afflict <hi>Dauid</hi> by wicked instruments, as hee also reuealed it vnto him by his Prophet; but they neuer once dreamed of doing that which God had decreed; for <hi>Absalon</hi> aymeth at the satisfying his ambition by vsurping the kingdome; <hi>Achitophel</hi> at the making of the people more bolde and resolute in following of <hi>Absalon</hi> against his father, when by his abhominable fact all hope of reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation between them, should be quite cut off; and <hi>Shemei</hi> ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at nothing but at the easing of his spleene, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorging his malice by his rayling and reuiling. Finally, it was the will of God that his Sonne should dye for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of mankinde; but those wicked instruments which were vsed for that purpose, neuer so much as thought of accomplishing this will of God. But the Priests, Scribes, and Pharisies sought in all their proceedings to establishe their owne estates, to maintaine their reputation among the people, and withall to reuenge themselues and satisfie their malice against our Sauiour, who by discouering their hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie blemished their glory, and wrought then out of the fauour of the people. And so <hi>Iudas</hi> aymed at a litle gaine, and to enrich himselfe with the price of blood. And <hi>Pilate</hi> feared the losse of his place by offending <hi>Caesar,</hi> or to haue in it those inconueniences which might befall him by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing the people. In all which respects, as the sin of these wicked instruments towards God is not at all extenuated,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:10735:122"/> by their executing of his hidden counsell, seeing they doe it not in obedience vnto God, but (being ouerruled by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence) whether they will or not: so doth it nothing at all lessen their wrongs and iniuries against the faithfull, in that they are but bare instruments, and the Lord the supreame and principall cause of all their afflictions, seeing whereas hee aymeth in them at their spirituall good and saluation, these wicked men doe al they doe out of malice and hatred, and that to the end, that they may heereby bring them to ruine.</p>
               <p>And in this regard as they are not to look wholly vnto thē<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 8. That we are not vtterly to neglect the inferiour causes of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</hi>

So that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer in diuers afflictions we are to looke only to the hand of God, which doth vse inferiour causes as meanes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments to inflict his iudgements and chastizements, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in themselues no malignity nor will to hurt vs, as when he causeth the aire to infect vs, the water to drowne vs, the fire to burne vs; in which cases we are not to blame the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which are priuiledged from malice and sin, and are but Gods bare instruments for the effecting of his will: yet when he vseth wicked men for his instruments, as wee are cheefly to looke vnto the hand of God, so wee are to haue some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect vnto them in regard of that malignity and sin which is in them, whereby they desire our hurt and destruction. For in all afflictions we are to consider not onely the action and worke as it is simply naturall, and the disposition of them to the manifestation of Gods glory, and our good, in which respect God is the cheefe author of them; but also an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall confusion &amp; malignity of the action; which is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ascribed to mans corruption by whom it is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; the former whereof being good and iust we are to like loue and imbrace; the other we are to hate and flee as being vniust, corrupt and wicked.</p>
               <p>And thus it appeareth that the Lord who is the principall<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 9. That the Lord so disposeth of the ends of inferiour causes that hee maketh them serue for his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame ends; his owne glory, and the saluatiō of the elect.</hi>

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it also followeth that as hee disposeth at his pleasure of the causes themselues, so also of all their ends, making them all serue to the furthering of his ends, which are the supreame and cheefe of all, as namely his owne glory, &amp; sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of his elect, and that when they seeme to looke ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, and to be not onely opposite to his purposes, but
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:10735:123"/> also infinitely contrary one vnto another. And as the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets haue euery one their owne motion in their proper orbe differing from all the rest, and most of all from the motion of the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> or that which is first moued, but yet contrary to their owne motion are ouerruled and daily carried with it, and as a man walking on the top of the hatches a contrary way to the motion of the ship, doth not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding goe that way which it goeth, because hee is moued with it; so when the motion of our wills doth excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly varie the one from the other, and all seeme to driue to a contrary end then that at which God aymeth; yet are they all so ouerruled by his power and prouidence, in whom we liue, moue and haue our being; that at last we meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and bend that way whether he intendeth. All which is brought to passe after an vnknowne manner and by such hidden courses, that we know not whether wee goe, much lesse are we acquainted with the motion of others, carrying them to the same maine end; like vnto many riuers, which by diuers and contrary waies, runne naturally and freely in their owne current vnto the maine Ocean, and yet neuer thinke whether they goe, and much lesse of their meeting in the same Sea. And thus all the ends of the King of <hi>Ashur,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Esa. 10. 7.</note> and all his armie were by God directed to that maine end of chastising his people and punishing the wicked and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; although (as the Lord plainely affirmeth) hee neuer so much as thought so, or euer aimed at this end. So the diuels end in casting the Saints into prison, was that being tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted they might be brought to make an Apostasie from the faith; but the Lord maketh Sathans end and action serue to<note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 10.</note> further the end which he had propounded; namely that by these afflictions they might be tryed, and beeing approoued might be crowned. It was his end in afflicting <hi>Iob</hi> to bring him vnto destruction, by causing him to curse God vnto his face: but God maketh the Deuils action and end to further his, which was, that he might bee glorified in the triall of his graces, the faithful edified by his example, and that <hi>Iob</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:10735:123"/> might be fitted and prepared to receiue a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his blessings here, and of glory and happinesse in the life to come. But this will more plainely appeare in the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> wherein as there were many agents, so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise many ends. His brethren being full of enuy, sought to haue him remoued, whom their father (as they supposed) ouerloued. The Ismaelitish marchants respected their gain, his mistresse aimed first at the satisfying of her filthy lust, and after at the reuenge of her scorned loue; his master, in his wrong conceiued iealousie, at the punishment of so great an iniurie as he thought hee had receiued; the iaylour at his ease and safetie; the vngratefull Butler thought of nothing but pleasing the King; the King sought to ease his troubled minde by vnderstanding the meaning of his dreame; the Diuell to bring by the sinne of many, innocent <hi>Ioseph</hi> vnto destruction. But all these ends so diuers and opposite one to another, the Lord so ouer-ruled by his wise and powerfull prouidence, that he made them all concurre to the effecting of his owne ends, which were the tryall of <hi>Iosephs</hi> graces to the glory of him that gaue them; which <hi>Ioseph</hi> in modestie<note place="margin">Gen. 45. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The consideration whereof may greatly comfort vs in all our afflictions imposed on vs by wicked men; for when wee see our selues assaulted by them on euery side, all of them ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming at our hurt and destruction in the generall, but yet ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried thereunto by their particular ends; one out of malice to our persons, another out of desire to reuenge misconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued wrongs, and supposed iniuries. This man out of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse hunting after a prey in our spoyle; and another out of pride and ambition seeking our downe fall, that hee may lay the foundation of his owne glory and honour, in the ruines of our estate; he out of enuy and hatred, thinking that he is better, if hee make vs worse; and another out of his greedinesse labouring to make vs worse, that hee may make himselfe better; then are wee to remember there is a supreame prouidence, wisdome and power, which ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeth and ouerlooketh all their actions and ends, and when
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:10735:124"/> they are most eager in pursuing their designes, doth make them, when they thinke least of it, to serue him for the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of all his counsailes and purposes, and the furthering and aduancing of those his maine ends, euen his owne glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and the saluation, as of all the faithfull, so also of vs among the rest.</p>

So doth hee by the same prouidence share out vnto vs the measure of our afflictions, giuing vnto vs a conuenient draught of this bitter potion, according to the proportion of our strength and patience. Neither doth hee let loose the Diuell and wicked men to assault vs all at once, according as their furie would cary them; but like the master of the masteries he sitteth by, and appointeth such aduersaries to contend and wrastle with vs, as may onely exercize our patience, and not wholy vanquishe and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it. And as he appointeth the manner and measure, so also the time of our afflictions, which al the malice and furie of our enemies cannot any iot lengthen or prolong. As wee

                  </note> causes of all our afflictions; as also the comforts and consolations which doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise from the consideration of them; now wee are to proceede vnto the causes moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and inciting the Lord to lay vpon vs these affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: and these are of two kinds; the first is in vs, which is the meritorious cause of all our crosses; the other is in God, which is his loue inclining him thus to chastize vs, that we may not be condemned with the world. First therefore (as order requireth) wee will intreate of the meritorious and deseruing cause of all our miseries and calamities, that out of the meditation thereof wee may lighten the burthen of our crosses, and make them more easie to bee borne vpon the shoulders of patience. The cause meriting and deseruing affliction is sinne, which is that strong cart rope or cable, whereby we draw vpon vs al afflictions &amp; miseries, whether we consider them as the punishments of a righteous iudge; or the chastisements and corrections of a gracious Father. And this the Lord plainely sheweth vnto vs in the 28 chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the booke of Deuteronomy; where hauing promised<note place="margin">Deut. 28, 15.</note> all blessings and benefits, and also protection and exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from all miseries and euill, to those who keepe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God; hee afterwards annexeth a seuere threatning to the transgressions thereof, namely, that <hi>if they did not obey the voice of the Lord their God, to keepe and doe all
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:10735:126"/> his commandements, then all his curses, should come vpon and ouertake them;</hi> and so expresseth a large catalogue of them, from the fifteenth verse to the ende of the Chapter. So the Psalmist speaking of those that are in prison and captiuity, saith that <hi>they dwell in darkenes and in the shadow of death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalm. 107. 11. 12.</note>

And as this truth appeareth direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the former testimonies; so also both by the examples &amp; confessions of those who haue beene afflicted. Concerning the former the Lord saith vnto the people of Israel, that their sinne was the cause of their diuorcement from him; and that for their iniquities and transgressions they were solde into<note place="margin">Esa. 50. 1.</note> captiuity, and their mother (that is their Church and nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) was forsaken. So the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> in the name of the

Why cryest thou for thine affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? thy sorrow is incurable, for the multitude of thine iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Because thy sinnes were increased, I haue done these things vnto thee.</hi> And this the Prophet acknowledgeth in his lamē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,<note place="margin">Lam.1. 5. 8.</note> in the name of his Church and people; <hi>the Lorde hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions, and her children are gone into captiuity before the enemy, Ierusalem hath greeuously sinned, therefore she is in derision, &amp;c.</hi> Finally our Sauiour implyeth this truth in his speech to the man whom he had cured of his grieeuous diseases; <hi>Behold</hi> (saith he) <hi>thou art made whole, sinne no more, least a worse thing come</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 14.</note>

As soone as <hi>Ionas</hi> (saith hee) entred into the shippe; God caused the surging waues to rise and swell, to teach vs hereby, that where there<note place="margin">Chrysost serm. ad pop. 5.

But being deuoured of a whale, hee not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding liueth; to learne vs heereby, that as to him that liueth in sinne, a ship is no safeguard, so to him who by repentance hath put it off, neyther Sea nor beasts are hurtfull or pernitious. And heereof it is, that being to cure one sicke of a palsie, hee first taketh away his sin, before he taketh away his disease. <hi>Sonne</hi> (saith hee) <hi>bee of good comfort,</hi>

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:10735:127"/> and iustice; and that whether wee consider them as punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inflicted vpon the wicked; or chastisements wherby he correcteth his owne seruants &amp; children: for what can be more righteous, then y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he should inflict those iudgements &amp; punishments vpō wicked men, which he hath denounced in his law against the transgressors therof, whether they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne this life or the life to come; seeing all both by right of creation &amp; continuall preseruation, are bound to obedience vpon condition of reward and punishment, as being the vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals and subiects of this great King of heauen and earth? and what can bee more iust, yea and full of mercy then for the Lord to chastize the faults of his children and seruants, that he may reclaime them from their sinnes, and withhoulding them from the broad way which leadeth to destruction, may draw them by this afflicted and straight path, vnto that happines which they formerly lost by following the delights of sinne? To which purpose one saith, that it is iust with God to scourge euery sonne whom he receiueth, that we who were banished out of the ioyes of Paradise for our rebellious desiring vnlawfull delights, should againe be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored<note place="margin">August. de pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. lib cap. 14.

In which regard wee are to iustifie God in all his iudgements, and beare with patience that which hee sendeth, not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is vnlawfull to repine and striue against them; but because the Lord heerein willeth nothing but that which is<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 137.

               </p>
               <p>Yea but the Scriptures teach vs, that our sinnes are not
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:10735:127"/> alwaies the causes of our afflictions, and that there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other causes which moue the Lord to lay vpon his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren these crosses and calamities: for thus the Lord afflicted <hi>Abraham</hi> whilest he required obedience to that difficult &amp; grieuous commandement of sacrificing his sonne, not for the punishment of his sinne, but for the triall of his faith; and thus <hi>Iob</hi> endured many crosses and calamities, not for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sinnes committed by him, but for the tryall and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of his loue, faith, patience, obedience, and other of Gods graces, against the calamities and wicked slanders of the Deuill.

Neither shall we need to feare any great errour in this behalfe, seeing besides all our other transgressions wee brought enough sinne and corruption into the world with vs, to deserue all the punishments of this life, and the life to come; and euery man hath in him sufficient fuell for the fire of vengeance and punishment▪ if Gods iustice and wrath doe onely inflame it. Yea rather let vs know, that this is the best and safest course to ascribe our crosses to our sinnes deseruing them, because (though we erre in respect of Gods secret purpose,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:10735:128"/> in sending this affliction which wee presently suffer) wee shall take occasion thereby the better to humble our selues vnder the hand of God, to approue and iustifie his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous iudgments, and to renew our repentance by sorrowing for our sinnes, as being the causes of all our smart, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to mortifie and forsake them for the time to come. Whereas contrariwise the errour of not ascribing our affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to our sinnes deseruing them, when they are in truth for this onely cause inflicted by God, is most dangerous and pernicious; seeing it continueth vs in our wickednesse, and hindreth our repentance; according to that complaint of the Lord by the Prophet. <hi>They gaue themselues to deceit, and</hi>

And for our direction heerein, let vs consider of certaine signes, whereby wee may know when the Lord correcteth a particular sinne with some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall punishment or chastizement. Whereof the first is, when being afflicted with some speciall iudgment, after exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation we finde that in the Scriptures such a punishment is denounced against such a sinne; as when affiance in the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature is punished with their insufficiencie and impotencie whereby they cannot, or infidelitie and treacherie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they wil not affoord vnto vs that helpe which we expect from them. When pride is punished with deiection and contempt; whoredome with barrennes or want of poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie; idolatrie with adulterie, and such like. Secondly, when as our sinnes are punished by law of requitall like for like; as when hauing dishonoured God by scandalous sins, the Lord in the very same doth dishonour vs; when hauing committed spirituall adulterie, we or ours are left of God, to commit corporall filthinesse; when hauing neglected our duties to our parents, our children doe neglect theirs vnto vs; and when hauing oppressed our inferiours, we our selues are oppressed by our superiours. And thus did God fit <hi>Dauids</hi> chastizement to his offence, in the sinne against <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah;</hi> for because hee tooke his neighbours wife to commit adulterie with her; the Lord tooke his and gaue them to one of his owne house, yea vnto his owne sonne, his deare<note place="margin">2. Sam. 12. 10. 11.</note> darling <hi>Absalon,</hi> to be abused by him in filthie incest. And
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:10735:129"/> because he had slaine <hi>Vriah</hi> with the sword; therefore the sword did not depart from his house, but the same <hi>Absalon</hi> doth first slay his brother <hi>Ammon,</hi> for that incestuous rape committed with his sister <hi>Tamar;</hi> wherin there was a double punishment of <hi>Dauids</hi> double sin; and afterwards rebelling against him, neuer rested till he had expelled him out of his kingdome, and seated himselfe in his royall throne. So when the people of Israell enquired in the land of their captiuitie, wherefore the Lord did bring vpon them those afflictions of bondage and cruel seruitude, the Prophet is commanded by the Lord to giue them this answere; <hi>Like as ye haue for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me, and serued strange Gods in your land; so shall ye serue</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 5. 19.</note>
                  <hi>strangers in a land that is not yours.</hi> Thirdly, when as we are taken in the very act, and our sinne presently is attended by our punishment; as <hi>Dauids</hi> numbring of the people with that fearfull pestilence; <hi>Ionas</hi> his fleeing from God with that dangerous tempest; and <hi>Pauls</hi> cruell persecution with sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine blindnesse and astonishment. Fourthly, when as our owne consciences doe iudge and condemne vs, as hauing brought vpon our selues such a punishment by committing such a sinne; for the conscience is Gods deputie to conuince vs, being guilty as worthy of such iudgments; and to put vs in minde that some speciall sinnes committed, haue brought vpon vs such speciall punishments; as we may see in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren, who adiudged themselues as worthy of all the miseries which they suffered, because they so litle regarded the cry and intreatie of their brother in his afflictions. Lastly, when as our sinne in it owne nature bringeth forth such a punishment as the fruite thereof; as when beggerie followeth idlenesse or wastfulnesse; weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and sicknes, the sinnes of vncleannesse, and double plagues doe accompanie impenitencie and hardnesse of heart.<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 4. That much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort ariseth from the consideratiō of the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cause of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, which is our sins, First, because we haue no iust cause of murmuring see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods iustice and truth is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested, and we receiue no wrong.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>And thus haue I shewed, not onely that our sinnes in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall are the causes of all our crosses and calamities, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so our speciall sins, of our more speciall miseries and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:10735:129"/> of which truth when our iudgments are throughly informed; after we haue made vse of this knowledge for the renuing and increasing of our repentance, both for our sins in generall, and those which more especially presse the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science with their guilt, and the whole person with their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment; we may in the next place make vse also thereof for the strengthening of our patience: and that in diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects. First, because wee haue no iust occasion of murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and repining; seeing God, as his iustice necessarely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, doth iustly execute his righteous iudgments vpon vs for our sinnes, and according to his reuealed truth infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth those punishments which he had in his word formerly threatned; and if he should not thus do; punishing sin wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer hee findeth it, and shewing his detestation of it in whomsoeuer it is, he might be esteemed partiall, and his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and truth would receiue impeachment. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord acquiteth and cleareth himselfe from such imputations, and manifesteth his iustice and truth by corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting and chastizing vs for our transgressions; there is no cause of sorrow and mourning (but onely for our sinnes, whereby we haue vrged God vpon the necessity of shewing his truth, and iustice to take these courses with vs) vnlesse we would be found enemies vnto God, and aduersaries to these excellent attributes, whilest we greeue because hee is righteous in his iudgments, and true of his word. Neither is there any cause of impatiencie, yea rather in this respect we haue iust cause of ioy and comfort; in that Gods iustice and truth are magnified in our afflictions; for better it were that heauen and earth were vtterly destroyed, yea both men and Angels damned vnto hell, then that the glory of God, who is the cheef goodnesse and supreame end of all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, should in the least degree be dimmed and blemished. But especially haue we cause of reioicing and thanksgiuing, if we consider that in all these our afflictions the Lord doth not so much punish vs for sinne, as sinne in vs, mortifying and subduing it, that by the death and subiection thereof,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:10735:130"/> we may liue and raigne with him. Euen as the Surgeon in applying of the corrasiue, hath no quarrell to his patient, nor aymeth at his torment; but onely seeketh to abate the swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling tumour, and to draw out of the sore the core of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption that it may be cured. Secondly, as this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may worke in vs patience in respect of God, so also in regard of vs, seeing wee are not at all wronged in our pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, nor haue any iniustice offered vs by God, but doe onely suffer those miseries and crosses which wee haue iustly deserued, and haue pulled vpon vs by our owne sins. And therefore when wee are exercised with any affliction, we haue no more reason to complaine of God, nor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine against his righteous iudgments, then the malefactour hath to cry out against the righteous Iudge, or to grudge against the iust sentence pronounced by him; nor haue more cause when we are in sicknesse, prison, pouertie or banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to bend all our anger and malice against Gods mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and inferiour instruments, exclaming against the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of our magistrates, the falsitie of our accusers, the ilnesse of the aire or vnholesomenesse of our dyet; then the condemned person hath to maligne the prison walls that inclose him, the fetters and bolts that bind and clogge him, the Scherife and officers that lead him to execution, or the hangman who by authoritie is appointed to execute the sentence which the iust Iudge hath worthilie pronounced. But if there bee any cause at all of complaining and exclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, it is at our sins which haue caused the Lord our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Iudge to take these seuere courses against vs, for his owne glory, in the manifesting of his iustice, and our euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting good, by reforming vs of our sinnes. If there be any reason of greeuing and mourning; it is because wee haue deserued these iudgments, and not because the Lord hath iustly inflicted them. In which regard the afflicted Church demandeth, <hi>wherefore the liuing man is sorrowfull, seeing he</hi>

                  <hi>suffereth for his sinne.</hi> Vnlesse we had rather vnderstand the last words as an answere to the question, namely that there
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:10735:130"/> is no other cause of sorrowing, but that his sinnes haue deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued<note place="margin">Micah. 7. 9.</note> to be thus punished. And in another place she saith▪ <hi>that she will beare the wrath of the Lord, because shee had sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</hi> To this purpose one saith, that by a right know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the waight of our sinne, wee doe much lighten the<note place="margin">Per hoc quod culpae pondus cognoscitur affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionis poena le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigatur.

Besides what a numerous ofspring of actuall transgressions, hath sprung out of the wombe of this fruitful mother? and of how many grieuous sinnes dost thou stand
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:10735:131"/> accused and condemned before the tribunal of Gods iustice by the verdict and testimony of thine owne conscience; for euery one whereof the Lord may iustly inflict vpon thee this and farre greater punishments, although thou be innocent of that fault which beeing imputed vnto thee is the cause of thy affliction?

And secondly I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere that as it is a meanes of patience to consider that wee suffer iustly deserued punishments from the hand of God; seeing it is most vncomfortable once to imagine that the

All which though they be incomparablie more and greater, then any one man indureth in this life, yet are they without all comparison lesse then those hellish and euerlasting punishments, which the Lord hath threatned against wicked men in the life to come.

But that we may not think these terrible threatnings of iudgement and punishment denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced against sinne in the booke of God, to be but paper-shot, which by the sound thereof onely affrighteth, but hurteth not: let vs looke into the iust execution of this dreadful sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

And to passe by the examples of Gods vengeance executed vpon sinners in all ages, recorded in heathenish and humane Histories; and those which euery man hath obserued in his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, let vs onely looke into the holy Scriptures, and set before our eies some few examples of many, which wee finde there registred for our vse. And there we shall behold the whole world drowned sauing eight persons; and all that goodly beawtie of the earth defaced and neglected; all her gay ornaments stripped off and cast away, because they were stained and blemished with mans sin. There we shall see So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Gomorrah flaming and smoking with fire and brimstone, that the land might be vnburthened and purged from these filthie inhabitants; and (as it were) aired and freed from the noysome stinke of their sins: And Aegypt plagued with great varietie of grieuous punishments, because vnto the huge multitude of their other sins, they added outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous oppression, and malicious crueltie against the people &amp; church of God. Yea there we shal see the Israelites thēselues after they were chosen for Gods peculiar, ennobled with so many royal titles, and speciall fauours from God, endowed with so many priuiledges and prerogatiues aboue al the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth, and made famous by the destruction of their enemies, and their meruailous and miraculous deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance; yet for all this exposed to Gods wrath, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroied by his fearefull plagues, when they transgressed his commaundements and sinned against him. Among these wee shall finde <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> men noble and great in their families and tribes, and much<note place="margin">Num. 16. 30.</note> aduanced in speciall fauours from God aboue the common sort, yet when they sinned by their rebellion, swallowed aliue by the earth, and descending quick into the pit. Yea when the Lord had chosen againe out of this choyce, and reiecting the ten tribes of Israell for their sinnes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:10735:134"/> in his speciall fauour the people of the Iewes; yet when they likewise sinned against him, wee shall finde them, first greeuously plagued at home, and afterwards by their enemies ouerthrowne, led into captiuitie, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with much misery; and being restored vpon a second triall, for their sinne in reiecting and crucifying Christ our Sauiour, finally cast off, their cities sacked and ruined, their land made desolate, innumerable numbers destroied by the sword and famine, and the remnant reserued to be scattered among all nations, that they may be vnto them a scorne and hissing, and daily spectacles of Gods wrath, examples of his hatred vnto sin, and continuall remembrancers to put them in minde what they are to expect for the like sinnes, who being wilde branches, were grafted into the true Oliue tree, when the Lord hath left such a fearfull testimonie of his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred against all impietie and vnrighteousnesse, in breaking off and destroying the naturall branches, for bearing and bringing forth these fruits of wickednesse. But aboue all examples of Gods wrath in the seuere punishing of sinne, are those of the first and second <hi>Adam.</hi> The former of which for transgressing one onely commandement, by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the forbidden fruite, and that but once onely, was cast out of Paradise, and that which was worse, out of Gods fauour, dispoiled of all his former happinesse, depriued of all those excellent gifts and graces, and disrobed (as it were) of those rich ornaments wherewith he was endowed &amp; beaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in his creation; and contrariwise was subiected both in his soule and body vnto all afflictions and crosses, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and tortures, terrrours and feares in this life, and to eternall destruction, death and condemnation in the life to come. Neither was he alone thus fearfully punished for this one onely sinne committed by him, in his owne person a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, or next heires, but in all his posteritie from the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, to the end of the world, because they fell with him and sinned in his loynes. In which regard we may true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say, that all the euils of this life, either the euils of sinne,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:10735:134"/> or the euils of punishment, all the Atheisme, Paganisme, idolatrie, blasphemie, murthers, whoredomes, rapes, incest, sodomie, buggerie, robbing, oppressing, slandering and all manner of outragious wickednesse; and also all plagues, warre, famine, sicknesses and diseases, all leprosies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions, agues, gouts, apoplexies, palsies, and the rest; all want, pouertie, shame, reproach, with all other miseries of this life; yea all the dreadfull torments of hell fire, and the euerlasting condemnation of those innumerable millions of reprobate and wicked men; are all of them the deserued punishments but of this onely sinne. So the second <hi>Adam</hi> our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, is a notable example of Gods seuere iustice in punishing of sinne; who though hee were most pure and innocent in his owne nature, and no corruption found in his heart, nor guile in his mouth, yet because as our suretie hee vndertooke to make satisfaction for our sinnes, by suffering those punishments which we had deserued, indured innumerable miseries and afflictions in the whole course of his life, as pouertie, hunger, weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, slanders reproaches, the tentations of the Diuell and the world, conspiracies and layings in waite of his malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enemies, treacherie and treason, hard censures and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking of his neerest friends; false accusations, vniust con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, mockings and scornings, buffeting, whipping, and crowning with thornes; and lasty, a bitter agony, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him to sweat blood; the crucifying of his blessed body, and which was aboue all the rest, the horrible and intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble burthen of Gods fearce and fierie wrath, due vnto vs for our sinnes. By all which it appeareth of what vnconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable guilt sinne is, and what infinite torments and plagues it iustly deserueth, seeing God hath thus fearfully punished it from time to time; especially considering that all these punishments were inflicted by him, whose iustice is so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and exact, that it is impossible hee should doe the least vniustice, iniury, or cruelty aboue the desert of sinne; yea in whom there also eternally resideth infinite mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:10735:135"/> which vpon all due occasions, are readie (if there were cause) to temper and qualifie this scorching heate of Gods furie, and rigour of his iustice.</p>
               <p>And thus haue I shewed how haynous and capitall sinne<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 9. That sin is most odious vnto God, shewed first by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whom he hath punished for it.</hi>
                  </note> is, both by considering it in it owne nature, and in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments which by Gods iustice are allotted vnto it. Now further we are to shew that it is also vnto God most odious and abominable: the which as it doth already in part ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by that which hath beene said concerning those fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full punishments which he inflicteth vpon the offenders; so will it be more manifest if wee consider the persons vpon whom he hath inflicted these punishments, and the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety which is betweene sinne and his mos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> holy nature. The first vpon whom God inflicted his heauie iudgments for sinne, were the Diuell and his Angels; who before sin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted were highly in Gods fauour, as being his most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and excellent creatures, endowed with a rich and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable dowrie and portion of his singular gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as purity and simplicity of nature, wisdome, power, beautie, iustice, and such like; but yet when by committing sinne they fell from him, they became heereby more odious and loathsome then the vilest of his creatures, and are still, and shall be for euermore pursued by his wrath, and subiect to his most heauie iudgments and hellish torments. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sinne could make such louely and excellent creatures, aboue all others most loathsome and vglie in Gods sight, then how loathsome, monstrous and misshapen is it when it appeareth in it owne nature, and receiueth no grace from the excellency of Gods workmanship in the creatures who commit it? And how bitter is it in it selfe, when it is quite without any mixture of their sweetnesse? when wee would to the full set forth the vglinesse and euill of any thing, we vsually say, that it is as black or bad as the Diuell himselfe; but yet as black and bad as he is, he is nothing so euill and vglie as any sinne; seeing this onely deformed and corrupted him, who was before glorious and beautifull; and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:10735:135"/> if it were possible for him to wash himselfe cleane from this pollution and filthinesse, hee would againe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare louely and gracefull, like the Sunne in his bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or as an Angell of light, glorious and beautifull. The next whom God punished for sinne were our first pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who also were before their transgression most deare vnto God and amiable in his sight, as beeing the most excellent part of this earthly workmanship, and not much inferiour to the Angels themselues, seeing they were created according to his owne image, in wisdome, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse and holinesse. But yet when they sinned against God by breaking his commandement, hee cast them out of fauour, banished them his presence, stripped them of all his gifts, and adiudged them to suffer all the plagues and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this life, and hel torments and eternall condemnation in the world to come. From which iust sentence few are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited, notwithstanding that all-sufficient price of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion payed by our Sauiour, but remaine still (for want of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying Christs merits by faith) reprobated and adiudged to euerlasting punishments with the Diuell and his Angels. But aboue all the rest, the hatred of God against sinne, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth most fully and clearly in the example of Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, who though hee were his onely begotten and most dearly beloued Sonne, of his owne nature and essence, and therefore of more worth then all men and Angels, with all other creatures of heauen and earth; and though hee were his immaculate Lambe free from the least spot or blemish of sinne and corruption in his owne most pure nature; yet when he found sinne vpon him, though it were not properly his owne, but the sinnes of the elect, for which as our suretie he did vndertake to satisfie his fathers iustice; hee so much abhorred sinne assumed by him, that he spared him no more then if he had been a meere stranger or vtter enemie, but made him to drinke vp the full vials of his wrath, vntill by his sufferings hee had fully satisfied for sinne, and washed it cleane out of Gods sight, both from himselfe and all the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:10735:136"/> faithfull, in the pure streames of his precious blood.<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 10. The odiousnesse of sin shewed, by the contrarietie that is betweene it and Gods most holy nature.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the odiousnesse of sinne vnto God appeareth in that contrarietie which is betweene it and his most holy nature; neither are fire and water, light and darknesse, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and hell, God and the Diuell, so opposite and contrary the one to the other, as the euill of sinne is to this cheefe goodnesse. In respect whereof, though Gods infinite power can doe all things, yet he cannot sinne, though Gods essence being incomprehensible be in all things, and all things in it; yet can neither sinne bee in it, nor it in sinne; though his goodnesse and loue in some kinde and measure be extended to all his creatures, for hee causeth his Sunne to shine, and raine to fall vpon the euill and vpon the good, yet doe they not in any respect extend vnto sin, but he pursueth it where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he seeth it with mortall and implacable hatred; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the beautie, excellencie or louelinesse of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in whom hee findeth it, any whit mitigate or abate it; but as the infusion of Coliquintida doth make all thinges bitter which are mixed with it, and is it selfe made sweete by nothing; so sin doth make the most sweete things bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the most beautifull thinges vglie, and the creatures which are amiable and louely, to become most loathsome &amp; odious in Gods sight; it selfe in the meane time being not made by any thing in which it subsisteth more sweet, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull or amiable, or any whit lesse bitter, vglie or odious. As therefore wee would account that a most palpable and miraculous darknesse, which the brightest beames of the Sunne could not penetrate and enlighten; that most bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which nothing can sweeten; and most hard, which nothing can mollifie or make ere the softer: So must wee needes confesse sinne aboue all things in the world to bee most vglie and deformed, seeing beautie it selfe can in no degree beautifie it; most exorbitant and execrable, which omnipotency cannot doe; most euill, which cannot bee bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the cheefe goodnesse, and most odious and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, seeing God who is loue it selfe, cannot chuse
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:10735:136"/> but detest and hate it.</p>
               <p>And thus haue I shewed how hainous sinne is in it owne<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 11. That we are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all manner of sinne.</hi>
                  </note> nature, and also how it is vnto God most odious and abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable: now wee are further to consider how farre foorth we are guilty of it, and so liable to that wrath &amp; vengeance, which is due vnto it. Where after vnpartiall examination, we shal find, that we are euery way most sinful and wicked; for wee are not onely guilty of the sinne of our first parents in whose loynes we also transgressed; but wee haue deriued from them that contagious leprosie of original sinne, which hath infected and corrupted, defiled &amp; disabled all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and faculties of our soules, and all the members and parts of our bodies. Our vnderstandings are blinded with igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, our imaginations onely euill and that continually, our wils peruerse to any good dutie, and cheareful in imbracing sinne; our memories registers of wicked sayings, sights, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples and actions, for our sinfull imaginations and concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence to worke and ruminate vpon, till they haue concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the like wickednes, and offered it to the wil, to be borne and brought forth by consent and fact: our consciences sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, senslesse and benummed, not performing their duety in admonishing and accusing vs for our sinnes; our hearts and affections are the fountaines of all corruption, and the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy forges wherein al concupiscence and sinne is hammered and forged, till it come to it vgly shape and fashion. Our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which should be vndefiled temples for the holy Ghost to dwel in, are filthy stewes and brothel houses, wherein our soules and Sathan commit together spirituall whooredome and vncleannes, our eies are full of adultery and open passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, whereat the Deuil at his pleasure sendeth into vs whole troupes of tentations to besiege and surprize our soules; our eares like two wide gates giue free admittance to all filthy and sinfull discourses which defile and corrupt the hart; and all the rest of our senses, what are they but pandors to the pleasures of sinne; continually betraying and exposing our soules to be defiled and abused by them. Vnto which origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:10735:137"/> corruption of our whole natures we haue added actuall transgressions, which as they haue beene hainous in their quality, so they haue matched and farre exceeded the haires of our heads and the starres of heauen in their number and multitude; the which wee haue committed through the whole course of our liues, both in our childhood, youth and riper age, before and after our conuersion, and that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through ignorance and infirmity, but also against know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and conscience, deliberately and wilfully, presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and with an high hand against God.</p>
               <p>By all which it appeareth that as sinne is hainous and of<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 12. That the small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the greatnes of our sins should much increase our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi>
                  </note> infinite guilt, and consequentlie deserueth infinite punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so we are infinitely guilty of this guilt, and innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly culpable of all kinds of wickednesse: now further (that we may apply that which hath bene said to our present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) we are to consider that the knowledge here of serueth much for the strengthening of our patience in our greatest crosses and calamities; and that whether we compare our afflictions with our sinnes; or with those crosses and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which God hath iustly inflicted vpon others, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding haue not so greeuously offended. In respect of the former we are thus to meditate &amp; reason with our selues; I am indeed greeuosly afflicted, but what is my punishment in comparison of my sinne? For if the least transgression of the law deserueth the curse and wrath of God, his mortal ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, all the plagues of this life, and eternall condemnation, hell and destruction in the life to come, then to how many curses, to how much wrath and hatred, to how innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fearefull plagues, to what and how great condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and hellish torments am I worthily liable and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, who haue committed sinnes innumerable in their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and in their quality and quantity hainous and grieuous? Seeing therefore the Lord for his Christs sake is content to remit so much of the extremity of his iustice and my deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued punishment, as that he is willing to forgiue and free me from those euerlasting torments of hell fire, and contenteth
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:10735:137"/> himselfe with inflicting on me temporall chastisements, and that to this end that I should not bee condemned with the world, surely I haue great cause to beare his hand with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and meekely and quietly to submit my selfe vnto his will, though it should be his pleasure to inflict vpon mee all the plagues and miseries which are incident vnto all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and not onely with patience, but also with thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to acknowledge in my greatest miseries with the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and captiued Church, that it is the great mercy of God<note place="margin">Lamen. 3. 22.</note> that I am not vtterly consumed. For if euery malefactour quietly and patiently suffereth his lesser punishments, when he deserueth farre greater, and thankefully acknowledgeth the mercy of the iudge, whē by adiudging him to the whip, he acquitteth him from the gallowes? then how much more patiently and gratefully should I endure all temporall affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions? seeing my iudge freeth me from those which are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting, although my sinnes haue iustly deserued them; and then how much more seeing hee remitteth the most of these worldly miseries also? and in stead of all inflicteth but some few, and that not those which are the greatest of all, with which neuerthelesse he graciously mixeth many bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and comforts, whereby their smart may bee mitigated, and their sowernesse sweetned. I am indeed greeuously sicke but alas I haue deserued the death of the soule; I haue many crosses lying vpon me, but if I had my due, I should haue far more and greater, euen all the miseries of this life and the life to come. I am tortured with sores, aches and paines, but what is all this in comparison of the merit of my sins, which haue iustly deserued the terrors of conscience and torments of hell? I am by death depriued for a time of my children and friends, but my sinnes haue deserued to be depriued of the presence of God, and his Saints and Angels, where is fulnesse of ioy for euermore; my earthly delights are taken from me, I haue lost my riches, &amp; my worldly honours haue left and forsaken me; but if the Lord should deale with mee according to his righteous iudgement, I might iustly for
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:10735:138"/> my sinnes loose all my interest in the ioyes and treasures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued for me in heauen, and be ouerwhelmed with shame and confusion among the damned spirits. I am in prison, but if I had my due I should be in hell; I am banished my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, but if the mercie of God were not farre aboue my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, I should euerlastingly bee exiled from the presence of God and from the heauenly Canaan. I am now subiect to the pangs of death, but it is such an one, as endeth all my miserie, and beginneth my glory and felicity; wheras my sinnes so grieuous and innumerable haue iustly merited the euerlasting death of body and soule. And therefore seeing the Lord dealeth with mee not according to my deserts, but his owne infinite mercies, inflicting vpon me short and light afflictions, in stead of hellish and euerlasting torments, and (as it were) doth but pricke me with a pinne to awaken me out of the sleepe of sinne, whereas I haue deserued to bee mortally wounded and stabbed to the heart; I will not only with patience and meeknes, but also with thanksgiuing and ioy, praise and magnifie his infinite mercies in the middest of those afflictions which he layeth vpon me.</p>
               <p>And thus may we strengthen our patience, if we compare<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 13.

Thou art hated and oppressed by thine enemies from whom thou couldest expect no better; but how many suffer farre greater euils from those whom they esteemed their dearest friends? thou art tormented with paine in thy body; but how many feeling no lesse outward smart, are also inwardly afflicted with the sicknesse of the soule, the terrours of conscience, and sorrowes of mind? thou art afflicted in thy conscience with the burthen of sinne, and the tentations of Sathan, but thou hast some wise &amp; faithfull friends vnto whom thou maiest boldly vnfold thy doubts and griefes, and so receiue some comfort for the refreshing of thy fainting soule; but how many are there as deeply per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and strongly assaulted, ouer whom Sathan obtaineth an easie victory being vtterly forsaken of God and men, and so left destitute of all meanes of recouery? Finally thou art assaulted with afflictions, but others are ouercome; thou art shaken, but many are ouerthrowne. Thou hast time and res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite granted thee by God, not onely to take breath and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther strength, but also to make good vse of thy afflictions for the beginning or renuing of thy repentance and strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thy faith, that so they may indeede be vnto thee cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements and fatherly corrections, which reforme thee of thy sinnes and preserue thee from condemnation; but how many hast thou heard of who haue suddenly beene cut off with Gods vengeance, and presently destroyed in the verie act of sinne, whose iudgements might euen in the censure of charity be intitled to the name punishments, which are not inflicted for the good of the partie who suffereth them, but for the example of those who see them? wherein thy state resembleth Gods faithful people, and theirs the cursed nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; of both which God thus speaketh by his Prophet; <hi>I

And though it were supposed that thou hast no comforts to allay thy crosses, but hast with thy riches lost thy friends, &amp; so art brought to extreame penurie; that with thy pouertie is ioyned sicknes; and that thou art alike wronged and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed with thy friends and enemies; that thou art both tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in body and minde, and hast no friend vnto whom thou maiest impart thy greefes; yet consider that there are many whose sinnes haue bene fewer and lesse hainous, who after all the miseries of this life, do now suffer the euerlasting torments of hell fire, in comparison whereof al these world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly punishments are no more then smoke to the scorching flame, &amp; a painted fire, to one which truly burneth. For how many children and fooles are (for ought wee know) in the state of condemnation, and in the place of the damned; whom we vsually call innocents, and that not vnfitly if wee compare their lesser sinnes with our enormous crimes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them hauing neuer committed any actuall sinne, but standing onely guilty of that original corruption in which they were conceiued and borne. How many hypocrits haue their portion with the Deuill and his Angels, who haue see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to serue God religously in their whole liues, and haue kept themselues vnblameable to the world, of many hainous faults and great crimes, of which if we were arraigned, wee must needs plead guilty?

If therefore we who by our more haynous sinnes haue bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deserued these hellish tortures and euerlasting condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, are notwithstanding through the mercies of God, and faith in Christ (for vnto beleeuers onley these comforts belong) deliuered and freed from them, whereas they perishe in their infidelitie for their lesser sinnes, then sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue wee great cause to beare not onely with patience, but also thanksgiuing, all the crosses and afflictions which are incident vnto this life; seeing notwithstanding our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits, we haue obtained so great a deliuerance, especially if wee consider that wee receiue this mercy and speciall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, of Gods meer grace, and free bountie and goodnesse, hauing done nothing more to merit Gods loue, nor deserue better respect by any thing which we haue performed vnto him, then those who are plunged into the deepest condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.

If not, then why is thine eie euill because God is good? or if thou wouldest haue a proportion equally obserued, then what can priuiledge thee from the euerlasting torments of the damned, seeing thou hast no lesse, yea much more deserued them, then many of those who doe now suffer them. Againe, why doest thou iudge another mans seruant, who standeth or falleth to his owne master? It may be thou hast more haynously sinned, did not hellish pride and partiall selfe-loue blind thine eies, causing thee to put thine owne sins in the hinder part of the wallet, and thy neighbours in the former; and to looke vpon thine owne faults vnder the cloud and vaile of false excuses, which will scarce suffer them to be discerned, or at least not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in their naturall greatnesse and scarlet dye; but vpon others offences through the spectacles of hatred, enuy or hard conceite, which maketh them seeme farre greater then they are. Yea it may be also (though thou thinkest the contrary) that they are much more grieuously afflicted; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heauiest punishments are for the most part vnseene; and that being wicked (as thou iudgest them) they do not escape a measure of punishmēt according to the proportion of their sinne. For, for ought thou knowest they may bee pursued with those hellish furies, the terrours and horrours of an euill conscience, and daily tormented with the scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flames of Gods fearfull wrath due to their haynous sin.

And therefore let vs not iudge before the time, but resting assured that, howsoeuer it fareth with the wicked, it shall goe well with those that feare the Lord, let vs beare with patience that portion of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction which God hath allotted vs, knowing that it is

From whence ariseth our chiefest consolation in all our distresse and misery, and not onely patience in troubles, but also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentednesse, thankfulnesse, and ioy in the holy Ghost. It is true that the former considerations, of Gods prouidence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing, ruling and disposing all our afflictions, and of his iustice mixed and moderated with his loue and mercy,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:10735:141"/> which layeth nothing vpon vs but what our sinnes haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, yea farre fewer and lighter punishments then wee haue iustly merited with our innumerable offences, and most haynous rebellion, may well perswade vs to patience in our greatest calamities; but yet if we stay heere and goe no further, our patience will be but vnpleasant and forced hauing in it no comfort, sweetnesse or spirituall ioy; for our flesh being sensible of nothing but of present paine, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hopelesse either of deliuerance, or of future profit by our sufferings; will make vs easilie to forget Gods modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in punishing, and the haynousnesse of our sinnes deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing farre greater punishments, and neuer comparing our faults with the euils which we feele, but onely looking vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the miseries which we indure, and our owne weakenesse and inabilitie to beare them any longer, will cause vs in all impatiency to murmure and repine against Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which hath inflicted on vs more heauie punishments then others suffer, who (as selfe-loue perswadeth vs) haue more offended. Or if our consciences tell vs that our sinnes haue iustly deserued these and greater punishments; yet (howsoeuer this may iustly cause vs to beare with more out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward patience that which wee haue deserued) it will not much abate our inward greefe, or increase our comfort, vnlesse wee be assured that God measureth out vnto vs this proportion of affliction by the standard of his loue, and will in the end conuert it to our good, bringing sweetnes out of bitternesse, and ioy out of mourning. Yea, rather the waight of sinne being added to the waight of our punishment; our euill of doing concurring with our euill of suffering, and both ioyned with selfe-guiltinesse, and the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Gods inflamed wrath, will but the more oppresse vs with greefe; when as we cannot so much as with any shew of reason case our selues by expostulation, nor vent out any part of our sorrow by iust complaining, seeing wee are the onely causes of our owne harmes. And looke how much it addeth to our patience in respect of God, whom we iustifie
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:10735:142"/> in his righteous iudgements; so much it increaseth our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiency in respect of our selues, who haue incensed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed so iust a wrath, and so mercifull a iustice to our ruine and destruction, and whilest it emptieth our hearts of grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and repining, and our mouthes of murmuring and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming against Gods wise prouidence, which selfe-guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes causeth vs to iustifie in al the euils which are inflicted on vs: it filleth them with fretting indignation, quarrelsome complaints, &amp; impatient inuectiues both against our selues, who haue beene the cheefe causes; and also against al secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary and inferiour meanes, which the Lord hath vsed as his instruments for the execution of his iudgments. Neither is it likely that we should stay here, but if wee doe not labour to see Gods Fatherly affection euen in his frownes, and to discerne the beames of his loue &amp; fauour through the cloud of our miseries and afflictions; we wil in short time like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactours fall out with iustice it selfe, because it maketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs, hate the vnpartiall vprightnesse of our iudge, as though it were the extreamest cruelty, and flye from his sight and presence as though hee were our greatest ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</p>
               <p>That therefore those who are exercised in this irkesome<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 2. That the world iudgeth of Gods loue &amp; hatred towards men by their outward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.</hi>
                  </note> combat of afflictions may haue not onely quiet patience, but also sweet comfort and contentment in all their crosses and troubles, we will in the next place shew, that the cause mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Lord to afflict the faithfull is, not his wrath and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, much lesse any malice or hatred which hee beareth them, but his meere mercy, loue and goodnesse, which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him thus to chastize and correct them, that they may not run on in the pleasing course of sinne, and so bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with the world. The which point and passage I hold the more necessary in this discourse, because both the world and our owne flesh are alwaies ready to iudge of Gods loue and fauour, and of his hatred and displeasure, by the outward estate; and therefore as they thinke those most blessed and happy, vpon whom God multiplyeth, and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:10735:142"/> (as it were) showreth, his earthly benefits; so they iudge thē most miserable and forlorne, who are in aduersity and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as being men reiected and forsaken of God, because (whatsoeuer shew they haue made in the world to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) they haue more greeuously offended him by their sins then any other. An example whereof we haue in the Iewes, who iudged those vpon whom the tower of Siloam fel grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sinners then other men, because they were oppressed with this heauy iudgement; and in the Barbarians, who condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned<note place="margin">Luk. 13. 1. 2.

                  <hi>Paul</hi> as a murtherer, or some notorious sinner, because they saw him indangered by a viper; and contrariwise mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified him as a God, because hee had escaped this bodily harme. Yea so fast doth this corruption cleaue vnto vs, that as long as we carry this flesh about vs, wee are subiect to be ouertaken by this false and deceiuing iudgment, though we bee in some measure inlightened and sanctified by the spirit of God. As we may see in the example of <hi>Iobs</hi> friends, who<note place="margin">Iob. 11. 6.</note> being otherwise wise, religious and worthy men, yet when they saw the greatnesse of his afflictions, they passed vpon him a most vncharitable censure; and when they could not with any probability iudge him a prophane and notorious sinner, because his life had beene vnblameable and vnspot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they condemned him for a cunning and secret hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite; who had made shew of those vertues which were not in him: yea euen holy <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe was much shaken<note place="margin">Psa. 73. 2. 17. 22</note> with this tentation; for as himselfe confesseth his feete slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and were almost gone out of the path of godlines and integrity, when on the one side he saw the prosperity of the wicked, and on the other the afflictions vnto which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and other of the faithful were daily subiect; yea so was the eye of holy reason dazeled, and the light of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures clouded and as it were ecclipsed from him, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposition of worldly and carnal tentations, that following onely the iudgement of sense, hee acknowledgeth that hee was become foolish and ignorant like a beast, iudging of all things by the outward shew; vntill hauing recourse vnto
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:10735:143"/> the sanctuary, the light of Gods word againe appeared and dispelled those mists and fogs of earthly and carnall errours which before blinded him. And howsoeuer being inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Gods word and assisted with his holy spirit, he still got the victory ouer this tentation, yet how often regaining strength by new afflictions doth it return vpon him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter him a fresh as though it had bene neuer foyled. For<note place="margin">Psalm. 13. 1. &amp; 22. 1. and 79. 5. and 77. 7. 8. 9.</note> if we looke into the booke of the Psalmes we shal find, that being exercised with afflictions he complaineth, that God hid his eyes, and would not see his miseries, and stopt his eares and would not heare his prayers, that he was corrected in Gods wrath and anger, and that his iealousie did burne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him like fire: and finally that God had forgotten and forsaken him, that his fauour was cleane gone, that he would bee no more intreated, and that hee had shut vp his tender mercies in displeasure. Thus also <hi>Ieremie</hi> was so farre trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with the violence of this tentation grounded vpon the prosperity of the wicked and afflictions of the faithfull, that though he durst not dispute with God because he knew him iust and righteous in all his waies, yet he dareth to offer<note place="margin">Ier. 12. 1.</note> a parley and conference about the administration of his iudgements. And the disciples themselues who were inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to afflictions, yet when they saw an heauier iudgement then ordinary inflicted vpon the blinde man, were ready to<note place="margin">Iohn. 9. 2. 3.</note> iudge that it was eyther for his owne sins or the sins of his parents. Yea this is not the errour of some few men alone, but euen of the whole Church in her afflictions; for euen <hi>Zion said the Lord hath forsaken me; and my Lord hath forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi>

                  </note> it behooueth vs to arme our selues against it, lest in the time of triall we likewise bee surprized and ouercome, and that the rather, because it maketh way for another tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion much more pernicious then it selfe, namely, for hopeles despaire, and hellish prophanenesse which attends vpon it, for euen <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe being pressed and pinched with the

But the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of this tentation more plainly appeareth when those are tryed with it, who being wholy carnall haue no grace to make resistance, for the flesh beeing pressed with the burthen of the crosse, is readie to conceiue, that the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions which it beareth are the signes of Gods wrath, and implacable anger, and that there is now no hope of receiuing any good by seruing of God, beeing so much displeased, nor of freedome from these euils, though there should bee a surceasing from the course of sinning; and therefore in this desperate case being tempted by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell or the world, to leaue the seruice of God, wherein there is no profit, and to run on in a headlong course of sin, wherein for the present there is pleasure and delight, it doth with all readinesse giue way vnto this tentation. An exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whereof we haue in the stiffe-necked Iewes, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause for their outward and formall seruice of God, they had not for their reward that worldly prosperitie which they expected, but rather were exercised with troubles and afflictions, they burst out into these desperate speaches; <hi>It</hi>

And in another place they professe that they thought it bootlesse to repent, because being punished in Gods wrath for their sinnes, they had no hope of mercy and deliuerance, though they should forsake their wicked

                  </note> foile our faith, and cause vs to make shipwracke in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous storme of troubles and afflictions; let vs first ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally know, that as worldly prosperitie is no certaine signe of Gods fauour; nor of his sinceritie, piety and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse who hath it, (the which I haue in the former part of this treatise plainly proued) so contrariwise worldly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity, crosses and calamities, are no infallible tokens of Gods displeasure; nor of his impiety and wickednesse who is tossed and turmoyled with them. For these things fall out alike to all, and as the Lord doth in mercy and goodnesse giue these temporall benefits vnto his children, whose god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse hath the promises of this life and the life to come; so doth he giue them oftentimes to the wicked and reprobate<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 8.</note> as their portion in this life, and that in his wrath and heauie displeasure, onely to encrease the bills of their account and fearfull reckoning at the day of iudgment, and to aggrauate the dreadfull waight of their hellish condemnation. And so in like manner as he doth sometimes lay these temporary crosses and calamities vpon his owne children and faithfull seruants, for their triall or chastisement, that heereby hee may further and encrease their eternall happinesse; so doth he sometimes inflict them vpon carnall worldlings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate sinners, that he may begin their hell in this life, and whilest they remaine on earth, may enter then into the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of those neuer ending torments of hell fire. To this
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:10735:144"/> truth the wise man giueth a plaine testimonie, wher speaking<note place="margin">Eccles 9. 1. 2.</note> of these earthly benefits and crosses, he saith, that <hi>no man knoweth either loue or hatred by all that is before them. All things come alike to all; and the same condition is to the iust and to the wicked, to the good and to the pure, and to the polluted: and to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not; as is the good, so is the sinner; he that sweareth, and he that feareth an oath. This is euill among all that is done vnder the Sunne, that there is one condition to all, &amp;c.</hi> So our Sauiour Christ sheweth in the parable of <hi>Diues</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that neither<note place="margin">Luk. 16.</note> worldly prosperitie is a signe of Gods loue, nor aduersitie of his hatred, and correcteth this peruerse iudgment, both in his disciples censuring the blinde man, or his parents as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous sinners, because of this punishment which God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on him; and in the Iewes, who thought, that the eighteene vpon whom the tower of Siloam fell, and the Galileans, whose blood <hi>Pilate</hi> mingled with their sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, were greater sinners then other men, because they were ouertaken by these great and suddaine iudgments; shewing that the former crosse was inflicted, not for the sinne of the<note place="margin">Ioh. 9. 2. 3.</note> partie or his parents, but that the workes of God might be manifest in him; and that the other were not thus punished because they were greater sinners then other men, but that<note place="margin">Luk. 13. 3.</note> they might be examples vnto others, of Gods anger against sinne, that they might bring them to repentance. But I shall not need to illustrate this truth by examples, seeing they are so ordinary in the Scriptures, that a man shall not lighty read any page in the history of the Bible, where he shall not find both afflictions and temporall benefits (as it were) in common cast out to the good and bad, sometimes the one, and sometimes the other flourishing in prosperitie, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 5.

                  </note> and cast downe into miserie and aduersitie.</p>
               <p>But though this which I haue said generally, may iustly take away all secure presumption from carnall worldlings, whereby they perswade themselues of Gods loue, because they flourish in outward prosperitie, and also all cause of
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:10735:145"/> horrour and desperation from them who are in misery and affliction, because there is no certaine iudgment by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall estate, all things falling out alike to all: yet seeing no man out of this generalitie can gather vnto himselfe any sound comfort, seeing he may be as well one of them whom God punisheth in his anger and wrath, as of them whom he correcteth in loue and mercie: therefore in the next place I will more specially shew, that euery faithfull man, who feareth God, both in his mercies and iudgments, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth to profit by his chastisements and corrections, may to his comfort bee most certainely assured, that the afflictions which he suffereth are not the fruites and effects of Gods wrath and hatred towards him, but of his fatherly loue and goodnesse; not the deserued punishments of his sinnes, but gentle chastisements and profitable trials, which shall tend to the aduancing of Gods glory, in the further enriching him with his spirituall graces in this life, and in the euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting saluation of his body and soule in the life to come. For the clearing of the former point, namely, that the afflictions of the faithfull are not the fruits of Gods anger, nor impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vpon them as punishments for their sinnes, wee are to know that these words, wrath, anger and punishment, are either taken largely, or strictly and properly. In a large sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification God is said to bee angry with his seruants and children, when he doth afflict them, but not as a seuere Iudge out of the rigour of iustice to punish the person for the sinne sake, but as a gracious father out of meer loue that he may destroy sinne for the persons sake; neither hath hee any quarrell to the party, but onely to the sinne; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in loue to his childe, and in hatred to his faultinesse, he doth by affliction mortifie the sinne which he abhorreth, that by the death thereof he may reserue his sonne whom he loueth vnto euerlasting life and happinesse. And so hee may be said to be angry, not with the person for his hatred to the sinne, but with the sinne, for the loue of the person. He is not angry with his children in truth, because hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:10735:145"/> looketh vpon thē in his Son Christ in whom he is well pleased, nor correcteth them in wrath after they are in Christ reconciled vnto him, seeing the cause of reconciliation for euer remaineth, euen the merit of Christs death and blood shed, whereby his iustice is satisfied, and his wrath appeased; but onely in semblance and shew, hee (like a wise father) frowneth vpon them, that they may be more watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ouer their wayes for the time to come, and not run on in such a course of sinne as would iustly deserue his wrath and displeasure. Hee is not angry in iustice, because we haue sinned, but in mercy, that we may sinne no more; not in his owne affection and disposition, but in our feeling and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, because our guilty consciences tell vs what wee haue deserued; and because the corrupt humours of sin ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here and cleaue so fast vnto vs, that our spirituall Physitian is faine to giue vs these bitter potions of afflictions to purge thē away, which for the present making vs sick, in our sense doth cause vs to conceiue and complaine of him as an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie who hateth and hurteth vs, if wee looke to our present feeling, and no to his end, which is our spiritual cure &amp; the recouery of our health. The like also may be said of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for if we take it in a large signification, it comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth both the afflictions of the godly and the torments of the wicked: first because if we respect the matter of them, and the euils themselues which are suffered both by the faithful and the wicked, they are al one. Secondly, because in the law they are threatned as punishments of sinne against euery one who offendeth. And thirdly, because in the sense and feeling of the outward man, they are both alike; euen as there is no difference betweene the smart of the stripes felt by a slaue and by a sonne, sauing that these are some time inflicted by a more light and gentle hand. But if wee take it in a strict and proper sense, then is punishment so appropriated and peculiar to the wicked, that it is no way incident to the faithfull and righteous. For punishment is inflicted vpon enemies, and not vpon friends; by a iust
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:10735:146"/> iudge and not by a gracious Father; to satisfie iustice by suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering that punishment which y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> fault hath deserued, though it be to the vtter destruction of the party offending; and not out of loue to preserue him from greater harme by reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming him from his faultinesse; because he hath offended al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and not that hee may take heede of offending for the time to come. Finally the cause of punishment is the fault of the party, and not desire of his amendment; and the end of the punisher is to reuenge and hurt the malefactor for the good of others, to whom hee serueth for an example of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice; and not to seeke his profit and benefit by reclaiming him from his fault; for iustice in punishing wil haue it course for sinne already committed, though the offender could giue assurance of his amendment for the time to come.</p>
               <p>But that the afflictions of the faithfull are not the fruits<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 6. The first reason to proue that the afflictions of the faithfull are not punishments but fatherly chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                  </note> of Gods anger, nor punishments for their sinnes, it may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appeare by these reasons; first because Christ our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our bore <hi>all our sinnes in his body vpon the tree,</hi> as the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> speaketh, and suffered the punishment which was due vnto them, that we might be freed from it, according to that of the Prophet: <hi>Surely he hath borne our infirmities, and carried our sorrowes, &amp;c. He was wounded for our transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 24. Esa. 53. 5. 6.</note>
                  <hi>hee was broken for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was vpon him, and with his stripes wee are healed.</hi> But I demand to what purpose did hee beare our infirmities and sorrowes, if wee must still beare them? to what end was hee wounded and broken for our sinnes, if they still wound and breake vs? or finally how haue we peace by his sufferings, or how are we healed with his stripes, if we are still at war with Gods iustice, and stil receiue stripes and wounds in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict? Againe had not Christ freed vs from all the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due vnto our sinnes, he were not a perfect Sauiour, nor did not offer vnto his Father a full and all-sufficient price for our redemption; for if he did perfectly deliuer vs from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, then from lesser sinnes as well as from greater; if he did perfectly saue vs, then from temporall punishments, as
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:10735:146"/> well as from eternall; if his sacrifice were all-sufficient for the sins of the whole world, then need we not (as the Papists<note place="margin">Esa. 63. 1. Luc. 1. 74. Heb 7. 25. and 9. 12. 26. Matth. 20. 28. and 26. 28. Ioh. 1. 29.</note> affirme) to haue the sacrifice of our owne sufferings stil offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to make satisfaction for our veniall sinnes. But the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures euery where, and especially in the epistle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes, teach vs, that Christ is a perfect Sauiour that he hath deliuered vs from all our enemies, and hath offered vnto his Father an all-sufficient sacrifice, and full price for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; and therefore there remaineth vnto the faithful, who apply Christ and his suffrings vnto themselues, no more punishments, nor satisfaction therby to be made vnto God: for Christ hath fully satisfied for vs by his all-sufficient sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of himselfe, and the precious <hi>bloud of Iesus Christ hath</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Iohn. 1. 7.</note>
                  <hi>cleansed vs from all our sinnes,</hi> as the Apostle teacheth vs.</p>
               <p>Now if it haue cleansed vs from all sinne, then also from veniall sinnes (as the Papists terme them) and consequently from all punishment, for where there is no guilt, there pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment hath no place, &amp; if we be freed from transgression of the law then also from the curse. It is true indeed that the afflictions which the faithfull suffer, are in their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the punishments of sinne, and as punishments are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced against the transgressours of the law; but Christ by his suffrings hath changed their nature, &amp; as by reconciling vs vnto God, he hath made him of a seuere iudge, a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Father, so he hath made our suffrings to become the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements of a gracious father inflicted for our good, and not the punishments of a righteous iudge imposed for the satisfying of his iustice, and the destruction or hurt of him who suffereth them, neither is it materiall, that in matter the sufferings of the faithfull and wicked be the same, that is, the same sicknes, pouerty, imprisonment and the like; for euen the sonne and the slaue doe often suffer the same stripes, but yet these are punishments, being inflicted by the hand of an angry master, for the fault committed; those the chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a louing Father correcting his childe for his good and amendment. And so though the afflictions of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:10735:147"/> and the punishments of the wicked are of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in respect of themselues, yet their nature beeing chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the sufferings of Christ, they doe now much differ both in respect of their agent, and their end, the one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from a Father; the other from a iudge, they to profit and doe good, and these to hurt and bring to destruction. And though these waters of Meribah bee all alike bitter to the Canaanitish sinner, and the true Israelite in whom there is no guile, in respect of their naturall tast, yet the wood of Christs crosse doth make these bitter waters sweete; and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying them from the coliquintida and gall of sinne, doth make them wholesome drinke and profitable potions, which will quench our thirsting after the pleasures of sinne, and the poysonous cups of worldly vanities.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Christ taking vpon him to bee our surety hath<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 7. The second rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son taken from the full payment of our debt by Christ our surety.</hi>
                  </note> paid our debt to the vttermost farthing, fully satisfied Gods iustice, and appeased his wrath towards vs by taking away our sinnes which were the cause thereof. For standing in our stead and taking vpon him to discharge our debt, hee was arrested by death at the suit of Gods iustice, and cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the prison of the graue, till hee had discharged our debt to the vttermost farthing, but now he hath brokē the bands of death, and beeing deliuered out of this prison is risen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; and gloriously ascended; whereby hee hath certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly assured vs that he hath satisfied Gods iustice by full pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our debt, and therefore hath left nothing vpon the score for vs to satisfie; yea he hath cancelled the hād-writing<note place="margin">Col. 2. 14. Gal. 3. 13.</note> of ordinances and the obligation of the law by nailing them to his crosse, and hath taken away the penalty of the curse, by bearing it himselfe. And therefore seeing Christ hath fully satisfied by his sufferings the iustice of God; he wil not require a new satisfaction by our suffrings and punishments; seeing he hath fully discharged our debt to the vtmost far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, he wil not vniustly require from vs a second paiment, or though it could bee imagined, (as bee it farre from vs that we should so imagine) that the iudge of heauen and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:10735:147"/> earth could vse this rigorous strictnes; yet hee hath nothing to shew if he should commence suite against vs, seeing our suretie vpon the discharge of our debt, hath cancelled all the writings whereby we were obliged to his iustice, either to make payment or to suffer punishment. Neither is that of any force which is obiected by our aduersaries; namely, that he suffered to satisfie Gods iustice for our greater sins, and so hath freed vs from eternal punishments; but hath left our veniall sinnes to be satisfied for by our selues, from the which we are freed, whilest we satisfie Gods iustice by our temporarie punishments: For the word of God hath taught vs, that he is a perfect Sauiour, that in him we haue full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and that his blood purgeth vs from all our sinnes, without any exception or limitation. Againe, as the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction which Christ made for vs was all-sufficient, and the price which he offered for our redemption of infinite merite and value; so both the iustice and mercy of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee accepted them for full payment, are also infinite. Whereas, if (as our aduersaries affirme) we are to satisfie by our temporary punishments for our veniall sinnes, then must it needs follow, that either Christs satisfaction was imperfect, and his sufferings so insufficient, that they needed to be patched vp with our punishments; or that being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and all sufficient, God should be, not onely vnmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full but iniust also, in not accepting of this full discharge, but requiring payment of a debt by vs, which our suretie hath alreadie discharged: either of which were blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to speake or thinke. For hee that suffered for vs was not man onely, but God also, and therefore needs must<note place="margin">Act. 20. 28.</note> his sufferings be all-sufficient and of infinite value and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and the mercies of God being infinite, and farre aboue all his workes, doe make him so farre off from punishing, where his iustice beeing satisfied, willeth him to spare, that when he doth afflict his Church and people for their sinnes, hee is said to <hi>doe his strange worke,</hi> vnto which out of his owne nature he is auerse and indisposed; to haue <hi>his soule</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Esa. 28. 21.</note>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:10735:148"/>
                  <hi>grieued for the misery of Israell;</hi> and to make stay of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution<note place="margin">Iud. 10. 16.</note> of these iudgements, till by reason of the multitude of their sinnes ioyned with impenitencie, <hi>there be no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Chro. 36. 16.</note> But as in these respects this assertion sauoureth of impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; so also of extreame follie, vnlesse they will with like impietie shift it off themselues by imputing it vnto their Creatour: For who can imagine that God infinite in wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and bountie should frankly, for the merits of his Son, forgiue our enormious and grieuous sinnes; and punish vs for these which are small and veniall? that his loue should enlarge it selfe to the remitting and releasing vs from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting torments of hell fire; and be straightned in forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs those sinnes which are small, and (as they call them) veniall: as if a King should out of his great liberalitie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue his poore and miserable subiect ten thousand talents; and afterwards miserably exact a base reckoning of some few pence; or as though a Iudge should pardon a malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour for his horrible treasons or cruel murthers, and should punish him for some pettie theft. But it is further obiected, that the iniquitie of Ierusalem is pardoned, <hi>because she had</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Esa. 40. 2.</note>
                  <hi>receiued double of the Lords hands for all her sins.</hi> Vnto which I answere, that this is not the speach of a Iudge punishing malefactours for their sinnes, and surceasing from punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after that his iustice is satisfied; but of a most gracious and compassionate father, who hauing seuerely corrected the faults of his sonne for his amendement, earneth in his bowels of loue and tender mercie, when hee knoweth his smart and paine, and seeth him humbling himselfe before him by true repentance. For that it cannot with any proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of truth be vnderstood of the satisfying Gods iustice by their suffering of punishment, it heereby appeareth in that he saith, that they had suffered double for their sinnes; the which must needs haue relation to the compassion of a tender father, the greatnesse of whose loue moueth him to thinke that a few stripes inflicted on his humbled childe, are enough and too much for his great faults; and not to the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:10735:148"/> iustice of a Iudge, proportionating his punishment accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the demerit of the offence; seeing the least of our sins being committed against the infinite maiestie of God, deserue the euerlasting torments of hell fire, and therefore cannot be truely said to be punished double, though all the plagues of this life were inflicted vpon vs. Besides, if wee should vnderstand these words of punishments inflicted to satisfie for sinnes, how will it stand with Gods iustice, and much lesse with his mercie and goodnesse, to inflict vpon his seruants twice as much punishment as their faults haue deserued?</p>
               <p>And thus it appeareth that the afflictions of the faithfull<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 8. The conclusion of the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reasons.</hi>
                  </note> are not punishments for their sinnes to satisfie the iustice of God, seeing our Sauiour hath borne all the punishments due vnto our sinnes, fully satisfied Gods iustice and dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged our debt, by offering himselfe vnto his Father, as a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for sin, and by paying a price of infinite value and merit for our redemption. And therefore, wee are not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished as slaues, but chastised as sonnes, not so much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we haue offended our heauenly father, as because wee should, being in awe and vnder discipline, offend no more. For if an earthly parent doth not correct his sonne, to take reuenge for the fault committed, but to keepe him from running into the like fault for the time to come; and taking no pleasure, but rather greefe and compassion in his smart and torment, would willingly pardon his fault and remit his punishment, if he were fully assured, that he would offend no more, vnlesse it be in regard of the rest of his children, whom hee would not haue encouraged to commit the like fault through this conuinencie and impunitie; then how much lesse will the Lord who is loue, mercy, and goodnesse<note place="margin">Suscipiēdo poenā &amp; non suscipien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do culpam, &amp; culpam deleuit. &amp; poenam. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust. de verb. dom. ser. 37. t. 10</note> it selfe, punish his sonnes to satisfie his iustice in taking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge by their paine and torture? especially considering that his iustice is satisfied, and their faults pardoned by the sufferings and obedience of Iesus Christ. For so one saith, that Christ by taking vpon him our punishment, and not
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:10735:149"/> being guilty of our faults, hath quite done away both fault<note place="margin">Filius Dei car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem peccati sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepit &amp; poenam sine culpa, vt in carne peccati, &amp; culpa solue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur &amp; poena. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust. de baptism. paruul. lib. 1. cap. 32.</note> and punishment. And againe, the Sonne of God hath taken vpon him the flesh of sinners, and the punishment without the fault, that in the flesh of sinners, both the fault and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment should be discharged and remitted. And therefore our afflictions are no punishments for sinne past, but are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by our heauenly Father to preuent sinne for the time to come, either in vs, after we haue felt the smart of it, or in other of our brethren, who seing sin corrected in vs, are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to take heed of it by our example.</p>
               <p>The third argument, to proue that the afflictions of the<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 9. The third rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son taken from Gods free forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs of our sinnes.</hi>
                  </note> faithfull are onely chastisements of a father, and not punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a Iudge may be this; where there is no sinne, there is no place for punishment; but in the faithfull there is no sinne, because it is not imputed vnto them, for first all their sinne is washed and purged away by the blood of Christ; and they being iustified for his righteousnesse and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are accepted as righteous in Gods sight. So the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that we haue <hi>redemption through his blood, that is,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col▪ 1. 14. &amp; cap. 2. 13.</note>
                  <hi>the forgiuenesse of sinnes;</hi> and againe, <hi>yee which were dead in sinnes, and in the vncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickned together with him, forgiuing you all your trespasses.</hi> To the same purpose the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, that, <hi>he hath washed vs from our sinnes in his blood:</hi> and else where, that <hi>the blood</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apoc. 1. 5. 1. Ioh. 1. 7. Ioh. 1. 29</note>
                  <hi>of Christ cleanseth vs from all sinne.</hi> In which respect hee is called by <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist, the <hi>Lambe of God which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away the sinne of the world.</hi> Secondly, all the faithfull are in the couenant of grace, this being the onely condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which God requireth, that we doe beleeue; but it is one speciall branch of this couenant, that <hi>God will forgiue their iniquity, and will remember their sins no more:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Ier. 31. 34.</note> if God so remit the sinnes of the faithfull, that hee doth not so much as remember them; how farre is he from puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing them when they are thus forgiuen? So when the Lord would expresse this couenant of grace by the similitude of mariage, he promiseh to marry the faithfull vnto himselfe
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:10735:149"/>
                  <hi>in righteousnesse and iudgment;</hi> and because on the one side,<note place="margin">Hos. 2. 19.</note> it was vnfit to beate and punishe his spouse, because of this neere vnion betweene them; and because on the other side, shee was so full of faults and infirmities, that by her sinnes she would deserue to be punished, therefore he addeth, that he will <hi>marry her also in mercy and in compassion,</hi> whereby in and for his Sonne Iesus Christ, he would remit and pardon her sins, and not inflict these iudgements and punishments, though she did deserue them. Finally, the places of Scripture where the Lord promiseth forgiuenesse of sinnes, doe plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly euince that God doth so pardon them, that he doth neuer call them into iudgment, neither in this world to punish them with temporall punishments, nor with euerlasting condemnation in the world to come. So he promiseth the Iewes, that if they would turne from their sinnes by true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>though they were as crimson, they should be made</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Esa. 1. 18.</note>
                  <hi>white as snow; though they were red like scarlet, they should be made like vnto wool.</hi> So the Lord saith by the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> that he would so pardon the iniquities of his people, that though one should diligently seek thē, yet he should by no means find thē. <hi>In those days, and at that time</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>the iniquities of Israell shall be sought for, &amp; there shal be none;</hi>

                  <hi>and the sins of Iudah, and they shall not be found; for I will be mercifull vnto thē whom I reserue.</hi> Now how can they be thus cleane purged and washed, if some part of the punishment doth still remaine? Or how are they not to be found, if hee who committeth them be punished for them? Againe, the<note place="margin">Esa. 44. 22.</note> Lord saith by the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> that he <hi>would put away the transgressions of his people like a cloude, and their sinnes like a</hi>

If in this life he bring them into iudgement, how doth he cast them into the bottome of the sea? And if by punishing he bring
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:10735:150"/> them to an account, how can hee bee said to couer, or not impute them? Finally the contrary phrases vsed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures<note place="margin">Iob. 14. 17. Ier. 17. 1. Hos. 13. 12.</note> being truly expounded, may serue as a comment to shew what these meane, for if <hi>to seale vp iniquity in a bagge, to write and register vp the sinne of the people with a pen of iron, and the point of a diamond, to bind vp iniquity▪ and to keepe it in store,</hi> doe signifie that God will bring them to iudgement, by punishing them in the wicked, and correcting them in the faithfull; then contrariwise not to remember sin, to wash it away, to hide it out of fight, and cast it into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the sea, must needs signifie, that God will neuer lay it to the charge of the faithfull, nor inflict any of that puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shment on them which they haue deserued.</p>
               <p>The fourth argument, which prooueth that the afflictions<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 10. The fourth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because our afflictions tend to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancing of our good.</hi> Rom. 8. 18. 28.</note> of the faithfull are not punishments, is because they do tend to our good, euen to the mortifying of our sinnes, the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying and encreasing of Gods spirituall graces in vs, and the furthering of our euerlasting happinesse. And this argument the Apostle purposely vseth to comfort those who are vnder the crosse, not only because our present afflictions shall bee ouerwaighed with an incomparable waight of future glory, but also because <hi>all things whatsoeuer,</hi> and they among the rest<note place="margin">1.

                  <hi>It is good</hi> (saith he) <hi>for me that I haue beene afflicted,</hi>

               <p>Lastly that cannot be a punishment which is either a cause<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 11. The fifth reason is, because our afflictions are a meanes of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal blessednes.</hi>
                  </note> or meanes of eternall blessednesse; but by the testimony of the holy Ghost they are pronounced blessed who are thus afflicted and corrected, the Lord vsing it as a meanes to keep them in his fear, and to instruct them in the way of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, which leadeth vnto this euerlasting blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and happinesse in his kingdome, according to that of the Psalmist; <hi>Blessed is the man whom thou chastisest O Lord,</hi>

                  <hi>before I was afflicted</hi> (saith he) <hi>I went astray, but now I keepe thy word.</hi> But what blessednes, or what comfort and conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation could there be in afflictions, if they were punishmēts, seeing they are fruits of the curse, and tend not to aduance the happines of the party punished, but to his hurt &amp; ruine? neither are they the causes or signes of blessednes, but the forerunners of his euerlasting destruction; seeing God by them, euen in this life, doth begin to shew his anger, and to satisfie his iustice by inflicting on them those tortures &amp; tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which their sinnes haue deserued.</p>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:10735:151"/>
               <p>And thus it appeareth that the afflictions of the faithfull<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 12. Their obiection answered who affirme that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids afflictions were punishmēts of his sinnes. Arminij respons. ad. 31. articulos. Art. 9.</hi>
                  </note> are not the punishments of a righteous iudge, but the gentle chastisements of a louing Father. Against which too maine obiections are made, not onely by our common aduersaries, but also by some amongst our selues: the first is taken from the example of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who though his sinne was pardoned, yet he was not freed thereby from temporall punishments; and though his fault was remitted so farre forth as it merited eternall condemnation; yet it was reserued by God to bee punished with such punishments as were corporall &amp; tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary. But vnto this obiection the answere is easie, if wee doe but remember what hath beene deliuered allready; for the rule generally holdeth, that where sinne, which is the cause, is taken away, punishment, which is the effect, cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth; but presently vpon the confession of <hi>Dauids</hi> sinne the Prophet assureth him from God, of the forgiuenesse of it,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 12. 13.</note> though before he had denounced those temporal afflictions against him and his house. And therfore seeing the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sinne is (as hath beene said) the not imputing, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, hiding, not remembring, casting of it into the bottome of the sea, and (as it is there said) the putting of it away; it is manifest that <hi>Dauids</hi> sinne thus before remitted, was not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards brought into iudgement, and hee punished for it, but that these afflictions were the chastisements of a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous father, inflicted vpon <hi>Dauid,</hi> not in hatred and reuenge, or for the punishment of the sin committed, but our of meere loue, to bring him heereby to more serious and sound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, that he might with more bitter greefe bewaile his sinne past, and bee more watchfull and carefull to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent it for the time to come.

Sam. 12. 24.</note> good, wee may adde another ende respecting the glory of God, which by these afflictions, whereby hee corrected <hi>Dauids</hi> sinne, was vindicated from the slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous blasphemies of the heathen, for whereas if <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> vpon his repentance had not beene thus corrected and afflicted, they would haue beene readie to haue accused the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:10735:151"/> Lord of partiality, seeing howsoeuer hee punished such hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous sinnes in others with rigour and extremity, yet hee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them well enough in his owne seruants, and could bee content to winke at their faults, suffering them with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to liue in enormous crimes. All which occasion of slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<note place="margin">Ier. 25. 29.</note> was taken away, when as God did thus beginne iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his owne house, and with such seuerity corrected the faults of his seruant, vpon whom his name was called. But yet with Gods glory was ioyned <hi>Dauids</hi> good; neyther did God punish him as a iudge, but chastise him as a father, not to satisfie iustice, or to reuenge his fault vpon him to his hurt, but out of his meere loue and mercy to bring him heereby to an hearty sorrow for his sin past, and to make<note place="margin">Si texit peccata Deus noluit ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertere, si noluit aduertere, noluit animaduertere, si noluit animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertere noluit punire, noluit ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noscere, maluit ignoscere. Aug. Caluin. instit. lib. 3. cap. 4. sect. 3.</note> him abhorre and flee from the like for the time to come. For (as one saith) when God forgiueth sinne, hee couereth and forgetteth it; and if he couereth it, he will not obserue it, and if he do not obserue it, he wil not reserue it in memory with a purpose to punish it. He will not acknowledge it, but rather pardoneth it. To conclude this point with the words of that excellent and worthy seruant of God; it is strange (saith he) that they should so cast their eies vpon this one example of <hi>Dauid,</hi> to proue thereby that the faithfull are punished for their sinnes, as that they are nothing moued with so many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther examples, wherein they may cleerely behold the free forgiuenes of sinne without any temporary punishment; for we read of the publicane, that he departed out of the temple iustified, and no punishment followed; <hi>Peter</hi> also obtained the pardon of his sinne, and (as <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith) we read on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his teares, but not of his satisfaction. So Christ saith to<note place="margin">Math. 9 2.</note> the sicke of the palsie: <hi>thy sinnes are forgiuen thee,</hi> but hee doth not withall impose any punishment.<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 13. Their obiection answered who affirme that the death of the faithfull is a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of their sinnes.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>The second obiection is, that the bodily death of the faithfull is a punishment to the body, because though the soule passe after the separation into ioy and happinesse, yet the body is punished for the time; seeing it corrupteth in
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:10735:152"/> the graue, and is not actually deliuered from death, vntil the time of the resurrection. The right indeede of houlding vs vnder his dominion is taken away from death by Christ, but from the actuall dominion thereof we are not freed till wee rise againe. To which I answer that death is to bee conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in it owne nature, or as it hath relation to the faithfull, in it owne nature it is indeed a punishment of sinne. But to the faithfull the nature therof is changed, and of a curse it is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a blessing. For Christ hath taken away the sting thereof which is sinne, and where there is no sinne, there can be no punishment. It was indeed a deadly stinging serpent which destroyed vs, but since sinne was taken away, like a serpent without a sting it cannot hurt vs. And there cannot be any punishment where there is no hurt or damage. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath now death (as hee affirmeth) actuall dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer<note place="margin">Arminius.</note> vs, seeing in Christ we haue gotten the victory ouer it; so as we neede not to crouch vnto it, as captiues to those who haue dominion ouer them, but as conquerers after vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie obtained by Christ, we may triumph ouer it, saying with the Apostle, <hi>O death where is thy sting, O hell where is</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 55.</note>
                  <hi>thy victory.</hi> Heretofore it held vs like prisoners vnder his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest till Gods iustice was satisfied, but this being done, this arrest is turned into a rest, death into a sleepe, and the graue is become to the bodies of the faithfull, as a bed of downe, wherein they quietly rest without all sense of euill, vntil the day that they are raised by vertue of Christ their head to be glorified with him. Neither is there now any hurt in death, (which hurt neuerthelesse alwaies accompanieth punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) but much fruit and benefit; and that not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the soule, which by this separation is ioyned with God, and enioyeth fulnesse of ioy and pleasures at his right<note place="margin">Psalm. 16. 11.</note> hand for euermore; but also in regard of the body. For here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is freed from all miseries and afflictions wherewith in this life it is turmoiled, as heat, cold, hunger, nakednes, sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, paine, with many such calamities; it is eased and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth from those painefull labours, wherewith it was spent
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:10735:152"/> and wearied, it is deliuered both from the oppressions and iniuries of wicked worldlings, yea euen from their society and company which was in this world so irkesome &amp; cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bersome. To which purpose one demaundeth, how it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth<note place="margin">August. de vita Christian. lib. c. 4.</note> to passe, that wee see the good and euill perish toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? and then answereth, that they perish not, but make an escape out of their miseries, who are freed from the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and persecutions of wicked men: but they truely dye and perish, whom the paine and punishment of a more fearefull iudgement doth attend after they depart this life. And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (which is a benefit aboue all the rest) it resteth from the works of wickednes, beeing no more subiect to our sinfull soules to bee abused by them, as their instruments for the committing of iniquity. Finally the Apostle reckoneth death among the chastisements wherewith the Lord corrected the Corinthians for their vnworthy receiuing the Lords Supper; <hi>for this cause</hi> (saith hee) <hi>many are weake and sicke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, and many sleepe,</hi> that is, are dead; and then addeth that when they <hi>were this iudged, they were</hi> (not punished but) <hi>chastened of the Lord, because they should not bee condemned</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 30. 32</note>
                  <hi>with the world.</hi> And therefore if death to them were onely a chastisement of a gracious Father, and that out of meere loue to preserue them from euerlasting condemnation, it was a benefit, and not a punishment, proceeding from so gracious an author, to so good an end.</p>
               <p>Yea, but by death the body is made subiect to corruption,<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 14. The former obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction further vrged and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</hi>
                  </note> &amp; therefore it is a bodily punishment. I answer, that though this argument holdeth in respect of meere naturall men, yet not in regard of the faithful, the corruption of whose body is but a preparation to their glorification; for they are sowne in corruption, that they may be raised in incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they are sowne in dishonour, that they may be raised in glory; they are sowne in weaknesse, that they may be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in power; in which respect they haue no more hurt, and<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 36.</note> consequently no more punishment by this temporary cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, then the corne hath, which must first dye that it
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:10735:153"/> may bee quickned, as the Apostle likeneth it; or then the gold hath which is melted, that beeing purified from the drosse, it may bee framed into glorious vessels fit for the Kings table. Neither is it a punishment to bee corrupted, when the corruption tendeth to perfection, but onely when<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 26.</note> it tendeth to destruction; seeing in naturall reason it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that the worser forme must first be lost by corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before a better and more excellent can be acquired and obtained. Yea, but death is called an enemie, which is to be destroied, and therefore vntill it be brought to this finall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, it is a punishment. I answere, that it followeth not; that because death is an enemie, therefore it is a punishment, seeing punishments haue their name and nature, not from the enimity and malignity of the secondarie causes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, but from the chiefe author who inflicteth them, from the end of their imposing, and the effects and fruites which they worke in the partie that suffereth them. As namely, when they proceed from an angry Iudge, and not a gracious father, to satisfie iustice, and not to reforme and benefit the partie; and when accordingly they hurt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite not, they damnifie and destroy the offender who suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, and doe not by his reformation make way for his saluation. And therefore though death be an enemie, and in it owne nature full of malignitie, yet seeing it is an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and as it were a rodde in the hand of our heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which he vseth for our benefit, and maketh it to serue as a meanes for the deriuing much good, not onely to our soules, but also to our bodies, the enimity and malignity thereof doth no more proue it to be a punishment vnto the faithfull; then the enimitie and malice of a slaue, who is commanded by a louing father to chastise his sonne accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his appointmēt and no otherwise, doth make it cease to be a fatherly correction, and to become a punishment, when as the father doth it out of meere loue to his childe, and notwithstanding the malignitie of his instrument or deputie, intendeth and powerfully effecteth the good of his
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:10735:153"/> sonne by this his chastisement. Neither doth this proue it to bee a punishment, because it is an enemie which is to bee, and therefore is not, yet destroyed; seeing heereby is meant the vtter destruction and full abolishing of it at Christs second comming. For euen now death is destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as hee is, who hath the power of death, the Diuell, and the rest of our spirituall enemies; namely, not that they should not assault vs, but that they should not hurt<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 14.</note> vs. It is true, that at Christs second comming wee shall haue full redemption and perfect deliuerance from the hands of our spirituall enemies, when as they shall, not only, not ouercome vs, and hold vs in their captiuitie, but not so much as molest vs, or disturbe our peace; but in the meane time their poyson, sting and strength is taken away, so that though they assault and tempt vs, yet they shall neuer be able to hurt vs, seeing the Lord so directeth vs with his wisdome, and assisteth vs with his power, that wee still ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the victorie, and receaue much profit and benefit by their encounters. And as this is true of all the rest, so especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of death, who in it selfe is an enemie, which is wholy to be abolished at Christs appearing; but in the meane time, the poyson and sting thereof is taken away by the death of Christ, and the nature thereof is quite changed, so as it is no longer a tyrant, which holdeth vs to our hurt vnder his dominion, but as to the soule it is a passage to glory and happinesse; so to the body it is but a sleepe a litle longer then ordinary, whereby it resteth from labour and sinne, that when the day of glory breaketh, and the Sunne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse appeareth, wee may lay aside corruption, and put<note place="margin">1.

                  </note> on incorruption, and hauing our mortall swallowed vp of immortalitie, may rise with full strength, beautie and vigour, to serue and praise God without paine or weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>And thus haue I shewed, that none of the afflictions of the faithfull, no, not death it selfe, the greatest and last of temporall euils, are vnto the faithfull punishments for sinne,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:10735:154"/> but onely the chastisements of a louing father, inflicted for his glory and their good; for howsoeuer the punishments of the wicked, and chastisements of the godly be in matter and in outward appearance, yea euen in respect of bodily sense, and the apprehension of naturall reason all one; yet is there great and manifold difference betweene them to bee obserued by the eie of spirituall iudgment, enlightened by the bright beames of Gods truth shining in his word. As first the chastisements of the faithfull and punishments of the wicked doe differ in their efficient causes who inflict and impose them. For they come from the hand of a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous father reconciled vnto vs in Christ; these from a iust Iudge, and from a powerfull and incensed enemie. They are inflicted in loue and fatherly compassion, which causeth his bowels to earne, and his heart to relent, so as he cannot cast off his children like the wicked, but receiueth them againe into his former fauour, after that they are humbled vnder his chastising hand; according to that of the Prophet <hi>Hosea, How shall I giue thee vp Ephraim? how shall I deliuer</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hos. 11. 8.</note>
                  <hi>thee Israell? How shall I make thee as Admah? How shall I set thee as Zeboim? Mine heart is turned within me, my repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 29. 23.</note>
                  <hi>are rowled together.</hi> As if he had said, though your sins are so many and grieuous, that I might iustly destroy you with fire and brimstone, as I did those cities adioyning to Sodome and Gomorrah; yet in regard of my couenant, and my loue which in Christ I beare you, I cannot deale with you as I did with those cursed nations; but when your sinnes enforce me to correct you, I do compassionate your griefes, and am readie to repent and surcease your afflictions, when you repent of your sinne against me. And with this agreeth Gods promise made to <hi>Dauid</hi> concerning his sonne <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. If he sinne, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Sam. 7. 14.</note>
                  <hi>the plagues of the children of men; but my mercy shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from him, as I tooke it from Saul, whom I haue put away before me.</hi> So that the Lord in correcting his children, doth<note place="margin">Hab. 3. 2.</note> (as the Prophet <hi>Habakkuc</hi> speaketh) <hi>In wrath remember
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:10735:154"/> mercy,</hi> and he doth chastise <hi>them in his iudgment, not in his</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 10. 24. &amp; 30. 11.</note>
                  <hi>anger to bring them to nothing, and vtterly cut them off.</hi> But contrariwise, the punishments of the wicked are inflicted vpon them in Gods wrath and heauie displeasure; neither doth he take any compassion on them in their miseries, but rather delighteth himselfe in the exercising his iustice and iudgements vpon them for their vtter ruine and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they differ in their impulsiue or mouing cause; for the cause mouing the Lord to chastise the faithfull, is his loue and goodnesse, whereas his wrath and iust displeasure conceiued against the wicked for their sinnes, moueth him to inflict deserued punishments vpon them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they differ in their end, for the Lord chastiseth the faithfull, that hee may manifest his mercie in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion,<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 22.</note> but he punisheth the wicked, that he may manifest his iustice in their confusion. Hee chastiseth them in loue for their amendement, that they may not sin; hee punisheth these in wrath to satisfie his iustice, because they haue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Hee chastiseth them that they may like gold be purified in the fire of affliction from their drosse and corruption, and so be made fit for Gods heauenly treasurie; hee punisheth these that like chaffe or stubble they may be consumed with the fire of his wrath. He chastiseth them that they may not<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 32.</note> be condemned with the world; hee punisheth these that their earthly miseries may bee the beginning of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 3.</note> and (as it were) their first step into hell. Hee chastiseth them to try them, that in triall they may bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued; he punisheth these to vex and torment them, by bringing vpon them that vengeance which their sinnes haue deserued.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they differ in their effects; for the afflictions of the faithfull doe much profit them, and further their salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but the punishments of the wicked doe much hurt them and further their condemnation. They soften and mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie their hearts, and make them to humble themselues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:10735:155"/> their heauenly father, imploring mercy and forgiuenes; these doe make them more hard and obdurate, and in furie and desperate madnesse to blaspheme, murmure and repine against their Iudge, because he doth execute vpon them his righteous iudgments. They not onely helpe to increase in them all spirituall graces, but also manifest them to Gods glory and their owne comfort; these both multiplie and manifest the sinnes and corruptions of the wicked to their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting horrour and confusion. They beating, and (as it were punning) the faithfull, doe make them like odoriferous spices to smell the more sweetly, the more they are brused, these vexing the wicked doe make them like filthie sinkes and puddles to stinke the more noysomly the more they are troubled. Finally, they serue as an vnpleasant, yet straight and direct way which bringeth the faithfull into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen; but these are (as it were) the porch and first entrance of hell, and like a stormie and tempestuous sea, which splitteth and sinketh the wicked on the sands of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speration,<note place="margin">Ideota inter orthodoxogr. de patient. verae contemplat. cap. 20.</note> and maketh them to wrack their soules on the rocks of destruction. To which purpose one saith, that to the damned and reprobate, tribulation begetteth pusillaminitie, pusillaminitie perplexitie, perplexitie desperation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speration confusion and condemnation.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the afflictions of the faithfull, and the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the wicked doe differ, in respect of their seuerall subiects, or the persons vpon whom they are imposed; for they are inflicted on sonnes, these on slaues, they on friends, these on enemies; they on Gods faithfull and couragious souldiars, whom after the victory he will crowne with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; these on malefactours and offenders, whom it is his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to punish according to their demerits.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, they differ in time and continuance; for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of the faithfull are short and momentanie; but the punishments of the wicked are endlesse and euerlasting; for as the happinesse of the elect and their glorification, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choate and begun euen in this life, when they haue attained
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:10735:155"/> vnto some measure of sanctification, vnto peace with God, peace of couscience and ioy in the holy Ghost; so contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the torments of the reprobate, are euen begunne in this world, when as they suffer for their sinnes temporall plagues and punishments, seeing they are the earnest of their condemnation, and the very flashing of that infernall fire.</p>
               <p>Seauenthly, they differ in their measure and quantitie, in which respect the afflictions of the faithfull are that gentle rod, whereby like children they are louingly corrected by<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 32.</note> their heauenly father; but the punishments of the wicked are that three stringed whip, whereby the wicked are scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and tormented like slaues and malefactours, at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment<note place="margin">Ier. 30. 11.</note> of their Iudge. They tending to correct in iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the good of the partie, and these to destroy and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly cut off, as the Prophet speaketh. And though there seeme to be no difference in outward appearance betweene the stripes of the sonne, and the lashes of the slaue; yet is there great difference in their inward feeling, seeing they haue much internall ioy, and comfort from the assurance which they haue of the loue and fauour of their heauenly father, euen whilest he correcteth them, whereby they are ascertained that all their afflictions shall haue a ioyfull and happie issue; whereas these conceiuing God to be a seuere Iudge, and an incensed enemie, doe with horrour and feare suffer the euils which lie vpon them, as the deserued punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their sinnes, hauing no better hopes for the time to come, but rather a terrible expectation of hellish con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation after all their worldly miseries, and calamities. To this purpose one saith, that there is great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene<note place="margin">Chrysost. de fide &amp; loge naturae. serm. t. 3.</note> the chastisements of a sonne and the punishments of a slaue. For the sonne is beaten, and so is the seruant, but he like a seruant who hath offended, but the other as free-borne, and as a sonne vnto whom discipline is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary. Neither doe their like stripes proue them to be of like honour, nor doth it heereupon follow, that because the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:10735:156"/> wicked and godly suffer the same things, therefore they are of the same condition; but correction is inflicted vpon the sonne, for his humiliation or triall; vpon the slaue, for his torment and punishment. And therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> knowing these differences, saith of the iust, that <hi>many were their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations,</hi> but presently addeth, that <hi>the Lord deliuereth</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal 34. 19. vers. 21.</note>
                  <hi>them out of all:</hi> shewing the cure and remedie as soone as the disease and maladie. But speaking of the wicked, hee saith, that many are the torments of the sinner, but addeth no comfort of helpe and deliuerance. Finally, as there are these and many such like differences betweene the chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the faithfull, and the punishments of the wicked, for the present in this world; so farre greater shall the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference be betweene them in that which followeth in the life to come; for the afflictions of the godly in this present life <hi>are not</hi> (as the Apostle speaketh) <hi>worthy the glory which shall be reuealed.</hi> Seeing as hee saith in another place, <hi>These</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 18. 2. Cor. 4. 17.</note>
                  <hi>light and momentanie afflictions, shall cause vnto them a farre most excellent, and an eternall waight-of glorie</hi> Whereas the temporarie punishments of vngodly men, working in them no reformation and amendement, but rather (as hath beene shewed) encreasing and multiplying their haynous sinnes, are accompanied with euerlasting torments, and hellish condemnation in the world to come.</p>
               <p>And thus haue I proued that the afflictions of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 15. That there were no comfort in afflictions, if they were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments.</hi>
                  </note> are not punishments of their sinnes, inflicted by an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended iudge, for the satisfying of his iustice; but the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements of a gracious father, by which hee correcteth his children for their profit &amp; amendment; and haue also shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the manifold and greater differences betweene the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments of the wicked and the afflictions of the godly, vpon the which I haue the longer insisted, because the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion of the aduersaries, opposed against this truth, striketh at the very roote of all true and sound comfort. For as it is the cheefe stay, to vphold fainting soules oppressed
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:10735:156"/> with the heauy waight of grieuous afflictions, to know, and to be assured that all which they suffer are the chastisements of a gracious Father, whereby hee correcteth them out of meere loue, for their owne profit and benefit, and not for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pleasure which he taketh in their smart and paine, but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on meere necessity to reclaime them from their sinnes, and to fit them for his kingdome: so when this stay is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and the afflicted party is perswaded, that the miseries which hee endureth are deserued punishments of an angrie iudge, inflicted for the satisfying of his iustice, beeing rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of all consolation, hee fainteth vnder his burthen, and sinketh into the bottomlesse gulfe of deepe despaire. For if he were vnable to beare the burthen of his afflictions when they were alone, what will become of him when the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble load of Gods wrath and displeasure is added vnto it? or whether should he flee for comfort, when hee seeth, that hee who is onely able to reeleeue him is an incensed enemie? How should he haue any hope to haue his afflictions lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or shortned, which are inflicted to satisfie iustice, when as his owne conscience telleth him that his least sinnes are of infinite guilt in respect of that infinite maiesty which is offended? or what shal stay him from fleeing out of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, when like a righteous iudge hee pursueth him in wrath to take due vengeance on him for his wickednes? Finally how shall a faithfull man conclude w<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
                  <hi>Dauid,</hi> that it<note place="margin">Psalm. 119. 71.</note> is good for him to be afflicted, if his afflictions be the fruits and effects of Gods wrath and the deserued punishments of his sinne, which hurt and profit not? or how shall he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them blessed whom God correcteth, if they bee still<note place="margin">Psalm. 94. 12.</note> vnder the curse, suffring those punishments which the Law threatneth? Whereas contrariwise if we be perswaded that the Lord is still our gracious Father, we wil flee into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some for refuge against all euils, and humble our selues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his mighty hand whom wee haue offended, hoping to receiue vpon our submission, mercy and forgiuenes, if wee
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:10735:157"/> conceiue that he correcteth vs for our profit, our future hopes will strengthen our patience to indure present smart. If wee be assured that God loueth our persons, and in all his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections aymeth at nothing but the mortifying of our sins, and our reformation; this will make vs also labour to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due them, and to amend what is amisse, that so wee may bee freed from our paine and smart. Which a malefactour who is punished for his fault neuer aymeth at, seeing hee know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the end of his suffering is not to amend him, but to satisfie iustice, which will haue it course, and not remit any of the punishment vpon the repentance of the party.</p>

That God loueth his children tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally like a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to profit thē &amp; not fondly &amp; effeminately like a foolish mother to please them.</hi>
                  </note> maine ground of the Christians comfort in the time of trouble and affliction, consisting in the knowledge and assurance of this point; that the crosses and calamities which hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth are not punishments inflicted for the satisfying of Gods iustice: now the other point propounded followeth to be proued, namely that they are to the faithfull the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements of a gratious Father, wherewith out of meer loue he correcteth them as his children, not for any displeasure conceiued against their persons, or for any pleasure which he taketh in their smart and paine, but onely for their profit and benefit, both heere, and in the life to come. For the clearing whereof wee are to know, that there is a twofold kinde of loue to bee obserued in earthly parents, the first a fond and cockering loue commonly incident to the weaker sexe, whereby in all things they indeauour to please their children, to follow their foolish appetite and lusts, and let their owne will bee the rule of all their actions, and therfore if so it please them, they are content to let them languish in idlenesse, or to runne riotous courses, which in all likelihood will bring them to perdition. But this is nothing else but with the ape to kill their yong with clipping, to play the enemy vnder the vizard of a friend; and to make them drinke the poysonous dregs of all mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:10735:158"/> because it is sugred with loue, and sweetned with the fond affection of an ouer-tender mother. The other kind of loue, though it make not so plausible a shew, is not in truth weaker, but much wiser; not lesse intyre and heartye, but much more discreet and profitable, as wholly aiming at the good of the party beloued; not caring much whether it please or displease, whether the things which it inioyneth be easie or difficult, tedious or delightfull, so they bee impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly behouefull, and greatly beneficiall to him who is to vndertake them. And this is the profitable loue of a wise &amp; discreet father, who somtimes withholdeth necessaries from the sonne whom hee loueth, not because hee grudgeth to giue them, but because he would inure him to hardnes, and make him more securely inioy his plenty, when he knoweth how to want sometimes, also hee crosseth him of his will, to teach him humility, and inureth him to such painfull la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as doth often presse forth of him sweat, and sometimes teares. But especiall this wise and fatherly loue doth shew it selfe, in keeping his sonne vnder a straight and seuere disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, in restraining him of his liberty, in containing him within the bonds of modesty, temperance and ciuility, in keeping him from running into licentious courses, and in reclaiming him from such vices and faults by due correction which being continued in without amendment, would fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the fathers expectation, and make him together with his comfort and ioy to lose his sonne; and cause the childe together with his Fathers displeasure to incurre the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of loosing his inheritance. Now that witlesse and worthlesse loue of a fond mother, as it deserueth not to bee respected and esteemed, seeing it tendeth to the hurt and destruction of the party beloued; so it is not to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of Gods children, from so wise and worthy a Father, who in all things aymeth at their good, and chuseth rather to profit then to please them. For hee knowing the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of our nature, how easily wee are puffed vp with
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:10735:158"/> pride, when we enioy worldly prosperity, and made foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wanton with a little cockering; how ready wee are to languish in idlenes, and to become effeminate with earthly delights; how prone wee are to dishonour him in his gifts, and how vsuall it is with vs to abuse these remembrances of his loue, as occasions to make vs both neglect and forget our benefactour, and finally how liberty bringeth vs to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousnesse, wantonnesse to wilfulnesse, and want of due correction to all dissolutenesse and disorder; like a wise Father out of meere loue hee keepeth vs vnder seuerer dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline; and though hee suffereth wicked worldlings and damned reprobates to flourish in their impiety, to liue with impunity in all manner of wickednesse, and to reuell and ruffle it out in all pompe and pleasure, because hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to giue them their portion in this life, and to let them fatte themselues against the day of slaughter: yet<note place="margin">Qui dedit tibi felicitatem hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius saeculi, ad cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solationem tuam dedit non ad cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptionem, &amp;c.

For (as one saith) hee granteth vnto his child worldly felicity to comfort &amp; not to corrupt him; and when hee seeth it thus abused, he doth scourge him in this world for his amendment, and not for his condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore wee must suffer him with patience, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting vs like a father; least we should feele him heereafter punishing vs as a iudge.</p>
               <p>And this truth is manifest vnto vs in the Scriptures, both<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 2. That God shew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth his fatherlie loue in corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> Ier. 25. 29. 1. Pet. 4. 17.

So the Lord saith, that <hi>he will begin to plague the city where his name is called vpon.</hi> And the Apostle telleth vs, that <hi>iudgement must begin at the house of God.</hi> So by the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> the Lord thus speaketh to the people of Israell: <hi>you onely haue I knowne of all the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the earth; therefore I will visite you for all your iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:10735:159"/> The wise man also vseth this argument to perswade vs with patience to beare the chastening of the Lord, and not to bee grieued with his correction, <hi>because hee correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him whom he loueth, euen as the father doth the childe in whom hee delighteth.</hi> To which place the Apostle alluding<note place="margin">Pro. 3. 11. 12. Heb. 12. 5. 6.</note> saith; <hi>My sonne despise not the chastening of the Lord, neither saint when thou art rebuked of him; for whom the Lord loueth he chasteneth, and he scourgeth euery sonne that he receiueth.</hi> Finally the Lord himselfe professeth, that he doth rebuke &amp; chasten as many as he loueth, and vseth it as an argument to perswade vnto repentance and zealous reformation, because<note place="margin">Apoc. 3. 19.</note> whosoeuer escape, yet they shall be sure to bee corrected (if they offend) whom he loueth and respecteth; that they may<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 32.</note> heereby be reclaimed from their wicked courses, and so bee deliuered from the condemnation of the world. And this also appeareth by the examples of the faithfull from time to time, for who more in Gods fauour then <hi>Abraham</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the faithfull, and yet how many crosses did hee indure? as the leauing of his friends and countrey, and the leading of his life, as it were, in a voluntarie ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment among a strange people, the offering of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued <hi>Isaac,</hi> and feare of his owne life? who more deare vnto God then <hi>Iacob,</hi> of whom he said, before <hi>he</hi> was borne<note place="margin">Gen. 47. 9.</note>

Who more gracious with the Lord then holy <hi>Dauid,</hi> whom hee affirmeth to haue beene a man according to his owne heart? and yet hee complaineth that when his wicked enemies wallowd in worldly delights he <hi>was afflicted daily, and punished euery morning.</hi> So it is said of <hi>Salomon</hi> his son that by Gods appointment hee was called <hi>Iedidiah, because the Lord loued him:</hi> and that <hi>Dauid</hi> receiued<note place="margin">2. Sam. 12. 25.</note> this promise from God in his behalfe, that he would bee his Father, and he should be his sonne; and yet the Lord addeth,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:10735:159"/> that if hee <hi>did sinne hee would chasten him with the rod of men,</hi>

                  <hi>Lord our God: thou wast a fauourable God vnto them, though thou diddest take vengeance for their inuentions.</hi> And therfore when we are in the middest of our afflictions, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding these crosses and calamities, we may triumphingly cry out with the Apostle. <hi>Who shall separate vs from the loue of</hi>

                  <hi>Christ? shall tribulation or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakednesse, or perill, or sword? &amp;c. I am perswaded, that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther death nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate vs from the loue of God which is in Christ Iesus our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let vs not content our selues with the general know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 3. That God in his loue appointeth to euery one of his faithful chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren a certaine measure of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiō fit for them, which cannot be exceeded.</hi>
                  </note> of this truth, that the Lord out of his infinite and endlesse loue doth chastise the faithfull for their good; but let vs further consider how this loue of God is manifested vnto them in their afflictions, by insisting in some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. To which purpose we are to know that Gods wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full loue appeareth vnto his children, both in the measure of their afflictions, and in his ends which moue him to lay vpon them his fatherly corrections; the which his ends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:10735:160"/> secret in himselfe, he maketh knowne vnto vs by those fruites and effects, which by these his chastisements hee powerfully produceth and worketh in vs. Concerning the former, Gods loue appeareth in the measure of our affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, first generally in that hee is content to afflict vs in some measure; for seeing our sinnes haue beene without measure both in their greatnesse and number; and haue beene also committed against an immense, infinite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible maiestie; therefore if the Lord should deale with vs according to his iustice and righteous iudgments, wee haue deserued that our punishments should bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out measure, number or end. But God infinite in mercie and goodnesse doth not deale with vs according to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts; but as hee hath graciously turned the punishments of slaues, inflicted by a righteous Iudge, into chastisements of sonnes inflicted by a louing father: so according to this loue and mercy hee hath measured out such a certaine stint and proportion of these afflictions vnto euery one of his children, as in his wisdome hee knoweth to bee fittest for them, and that both in respect of their quantitie, what and how much they shall beare, and also in respect of their time and continuance, when and how long they shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure them. In which respect we may truely affirme, that as there is no crosse, calamitie or affliction, which is not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed of God; and ordered, ruled and disposed by his most wise and all-ruling prouidence; so the quantitie how much, and the time how long, is also by the same wisdome, and prouidence ordained and appointed, in such an exact and strict manner, that as it is impossible for any man to free himselfe, in whole or in part, from any of that measure which is shared and alloted vnto him; or to preuent it from comming, or to escape from it, being come before the appointed time; so is it alike impossible, that all the power of Diuels or men should adde one dram to the waight, or one minute to the time of our afflictions, more then that proportion which God by his powerfull wisdome hath
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:10735:160"/> measured out vnto them. For as he hath said to the waters of the sea, so also to these floods of affliction, <hi>Hitherto shall</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob. 38. 11.</note>
                  <hi>ye come, but no further, and here shall ye stay your proud waues.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 80. 5.</note> To this purpose the Psalmist saith, that God <hi>had fed his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with the bread of teares, and giuen them teares to drinke with great measure.</hi> So the Church in her afflictions ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her faith vpon this truth in her prayers vnto God for helpe and deliuerance. <hi>Be not angry, O Lord, aboue measure, neither remember iniquitie for euer:</hi> and againe, <hi>Wilt thou</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Esa. 64. 9. 12.</note>
                  <hi>hold thy peace, and afflict vs aboue measure?</hi> As though shee should say, I am assured that thou wilt not doe it, seeing it is contrarie to thy nature, word and vsuall custome.

The loue and mercy of God appeareth in the measure of our afflictions, both in respect of their quantity which is but small, and in their time which is but short; for either they are light, or they are not long and if they be great in quantity, they are but momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in their continuance; or if they be tedious in time, they are easie in waight; and therfore may be born with patience, either in regard of our sense, because they do not trouble vs much, being themselues light and small, or in respect of our hope, because they will not trouble vs long, seeing they are but short▪ and momentany: yea

And now he hath fitted another burthen for vs, not according to the measure of our sinnes but of our strength: not that intollerable burthen of sinne and punishment, which would oppresse vs, and cause vs to sinke into the gulfe of desperation, but a sweet, light and easie burthen of afflictions, as our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our calleth it, to keepe vs who are light vpon the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance<note place="margin">Math. 11. 30▪</note> (as the Psalmist speaketh) from beeing puffed vp<note place="margin">Psal. 62. 9.</note> and blowne away with the wind of worldly vanities. And this he layeth vpon vs, not to toyle and tyre vs, but that it may serue as an easie yoke to keepe vs in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to inable vs the more fitly to draw and labour
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:10735:162"/> in the way of Gods commandements, which in the end will bring rest to our soules: not to ouer burthen and sinke vs in this sea of miseries; but rather to ballast vs, that we be not ouer set with the boisterous blasts of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans temptations, and to keepe vs in a right course that we be not wrackt vpon the rocks of sinne. So the author of the book of Wisedome saith; <hi>Therefore thou chastnest them by little and litle that offend; and warnest them by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>

                  <hi>them in remembrance wherin they haue offended, that leauing their wickednes they may beleeue on thee O Lord.</hi> And this small measure of affliction which the Lord hath prepared for vs, is signified in the scriptures by the name of a cup, which by our heauenly father is mingled and prouided for our drinking; for it is not said that we must drinke a sea of sorrowes, or an infinite measure of punishment, as our sinnes haue deserued; no nor yet a<note place="margin">Non cadus sed calix.</note> barrell or great vessell, but onely a little cup. The which we must not drinke alone; for the Lord hath caused his sonne our Sauiour to drinke the very dregs thereof, euen to the bottome, and hath onely left a little pittance for vs to tast &amp; sip of, which by the death of Christ is so cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and purified from the poison of Gods wrath, and so sugred and sweetned with his merits and obedience, that not only the chiefe loathsomnesse thereof is taken away, but also it is made hereby, of a mortall poison which would haue killed vs, a wholesome preseruatiue to keepe vs from the contagion of sinne, and a profitable potion to purge vs from our corruptions. In regard whereof our afflictions and griefs are but shadowes and resemblances, rather then substantiall euills, &amp; are rather vizards to fright children in Christ, then true enemies which intend vs hurt. And therfore the Apostle speaking of them saith, <hi>As dying and behold we liue, as chastened,</hi>

For as the childe seeing euen his friend and familiar acquaintance approching towards him, disguised with some vgly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, is at first sight much affrighted, and ready to cry out, and runne away; but when the vizard is laid aside, returneth to himselfe, and being freed from feare, doth take knowledge of the party, and turne all his feare into iest, &amp; meriment: so our afflictiōs like a vizar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded friend, doe at the first appearing much amate vs, but when the vizard is remoued, and wee vpon better acquaintance finde, that they are not enemies that hurt vs, but friends, from whom wee receiue much good &amp; benefit, then doe we grow familiar with them, and notwithstanding that their company is vnpleasant to our sense, yet doe wee not with any great earnestnes desire to bee freed from it, because wee finde it so nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssary and profitable. And thus it appeareth that our afflictions are both light and small; not that our sinnes haue not deserued more sharpe chastisements; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a little correction seemeth enough, vnto our most deare and louing Father, who so tenderly affecteth vs, that when hee hath giuen vs scarce the hundreth part of the stripes which our faults haue deserued, hee earneth and relenteth in the bowels of his compassion, &amp; thinking our correction more then enough, yea dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our sinnes, he pardoneth our iniquities, and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously<note place="margin">Esay 40. 2.</note> receiueth vs into his former <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Concerning the former, the Lord doth not measure out our afflictions
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:10735:166"/> according to our faults but according to our strength, and looketh not what we haue deserued, but what we are able to beare; for as the Prophet saith, <hi>in his anger he</hi>

                  <hi>doth remember mercy,</hi> which maketh him in all our cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements to intend our profit, and not our punishment.

He doth not obserue in sharing of afflictions an Arithmeticall proportion, giuing to all indifferently the same number and measure; but like a wise Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trician he doth proportionate &amp; fit them to the strength of the bearers, alotting a greater burthen to the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and a lesse to the weakest. In which respect he is said<note place="margin">Ier. 10. 24. 30. 11.</note>

But this truth will more manifestly appeare, both by the scriptures, and by reason it selfe grounded vpon them.

And as the wise captaine and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der doth not alwaies tire and weare out his seruants, with long marches, wearisome watchings, and fierce skirmishes and assaultes; but after their tedious labours bringeth them into garrisons, that taking their rest and repose, and refreshing them selues with wholsome diet, good lodging, and pleasant recreations, they may renew their strength and courage, and afterwards bee more fit for seruice and imployment: so dealeth our great Commaunder with vs, in this spirituall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, giuing vnto vs a breathing time after our fight, rest after our labours, recreation after sorrowes, and after troubles and afflictions, comforts and refreshings; that so hauing recouered our strength, and taken new cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage vnto vs, wee may the better bee inabled to doe him further seruice.

Besides, those things which are good, and delightfull, doe when they are past, easily slip out of memory, but that which is euil and greeuous maketh such a deepe impression, that though it bee past, yet it is neuer forgotten.

And being resolued to torment our selues with excessiue sorrow, wee vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily forget all the good things which wee inioy, and imploy all our wit to inuent and finde out argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to iustifie our greife; that so wee may haue some

For, there is no faithfull man, though for the present neuer so miserable, who hath not had the fruition of many of Gods fauous in former times; the which he may to his comfort enioy by a gratefull remembrance, not taking occasion thereby to aggrauate his griefes, by calling to mind what hee hath lost, but rather to renew his ioy in himselfe and thankfulnes towards God, by thinking how long he did enioy them. As we may see in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Iob,</hi> who in his greatest extremities armed his patience, with the remembrance of those manifold bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings which he had receiued from God in former times; <hi>Shall we</hi> (sayth he) <hi>receiue good at the hand of God, and</hi>

                  <hi>not receiue euill?</hi> Yea there is no man so ouerwhelmed with miseries, but that if it would please him to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them, he might finde as many of Gods mercies to set against them, which might serue to counterpoise the weight of his afflictions, and as much raise him with ioy and comfort, as he is deiected with griefe and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinesse. Thou art troubled with sicknesse; but thou hast sufficient wealth to prouide diet, physick and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries. Thou art weake and of a tender nature; but thou inioyest such a competency, as may maintaine thee
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:10735:175"/> without any great labour. Thou art poore in estate; but thou hast thine health and strength, whereby thou art inabled to take such paines as may earne thy liuing. Thou hast a troubled minde; but thou hast a strong bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or many friends which refresh thee with their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. Thou hast a weake bodie; but thou hast a coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious heart. Thou hast no goods nor meanes of getting them; but thou hast some friends which take care of thee. Thou art destitute of friends; but thou art able to liue of thy selfe without their helpe. Thou hast some bad children which grieue thee; but thou hast some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good which do delight thee: or, thou hast a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wife which may supply the defect of all other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. Thou art vexed with miseries all the day, one griefe pursuing another; but thou hast rest in the night, and when sleepe commeth thy sorrowes vanish. In a word, God vexeth vs not with a continuall feauer of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, but onely with some ague fits, which haue a good day as well as a bad; or at least haue many inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions, if they be <hi>quotidian.</hi> Hee doth not suffer these spirituall enemies so continually to assault vs, but that hee granteth vnto vs many breathing times to recouer our strength; and if hee suffer them to giue vs great blowes, he grueth vs also strong armour to beare them off: He will not depriue vs of all his benefits at once, but if he cause the sunne of our chiefe ioy to set, he will make it to rise againe (as it were) the next day, and in the meane time he will supply the absence of this our great light, with the innumerable starres of lesser com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. Yea (as I said) he so intermixeth comforts vvith our crosses that we neuer haue such cause of griefe, but that we haue as much cause of gladnesse. Thus hee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away a good mother from <hi>Isaac,</hi> but hee comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth<note place="margin">Gen. 24. 67 1. Sam. 1. cap. 29. 31.</note> him in his losse by giuing him a vertuous wife: thus when <hi>Leah</hi> was despised he made her fruitfull; and when <hi>Rachel</hi> and <hi>Hannah</hi> were barren, he comforteth
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:10735:175"/> them in their husbands loue. Thus <hi>Dauid,</hi> when he serued a malitious King who sought his life, was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced in the loue of a gracious Prince, who was as carefull to preserue him, as his father violent in seeking his destruction; and when he was vexed with vngraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sonnes, he was comforted in the loue of most faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full seruants. And therefore, when as wee still enioy from God so many benefits with our crosses, let vs not so wholly be taken vp in thinking on our afflictions, as that wee neuer meditate vpon Gods blessings ioined with them: for this is but like the Leach, to feede vpon corrupted bloud, and to leaue that which is pure and sound; or like the foolish Merchant, of whom <hi>Plutarch</hi>

               <p>To which I answer, that what shew soeuer such haue made, they were at the best but meere hypocrites, vnto whom Gods promises of not tempting aboue power, and afflicting aboue strength are not made, seeing they are appropriated only to true beleeuers.

Neither shold it seem strange vnto vs, that these green blades, which for want of ground neuer tooke root, do wither away when the sunne of tribulation and affliction ariseth, seeing our sauiour Christ hath long agoe giuen vs warning of it.<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 20, 21.</note> Neither doth this befall them because God laieth vpon them intollerable affliction; but because through their weaknesse and naturall corruption, they are able to bear nothing; nor is their destruction to be imputed to the greatnesse and grieuousnesse of their miseries, but to their infirmnesse and impotency in enduring any triall.
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:10735:180"/> For if a man through the weaknesse of his stomacke doe not receiue or retaine a profitable potion, which would purge him from his corrupt humours and restore him to health, because it is vnpleasant and bitter to his tast, and so dieth for want of helpe, his death and destruction is not to be ascribed to the physicke, but to his indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion who would or could not take it: So the ruine and ouerthrow of hypocrites is not to be ascribed to their bitter potions of afflictions, which if they were taken according to the prescript of our wise Physicion, would purge them of their corruptions and recouer their strength; but to their owne impotency and sinfull im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillity, which cannot beare nor profit by them.

To this purpose one sayth, that it is a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar<note place="margin">Gregor. moral. lib. 3. cap. 7.</note> comfort in the time of affliction, to call often to mind Gods blessings and benefits; neither will our griefes breake and depresse vs, if wee vphold and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort our fainting and sinking soules, by calling to our remembrance the gifts of God bestowed on vs. And therefore it is well sayd: <hi>In thy good dayes be not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull</hi>

And as in these regards there is necessity of sending these afflictions in respect of euery particular faithfull man, so also in regard of the whole Church in generall. For as it is neuer more spiritually poore and leane, then when it is pampered in worldly pompe, and prosperity; so it is neuer richer, or in better liking, then when it is outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pinched with misery, and affliction.

And if wee haue a potion of the largest size, and loathsome in tast, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for vs, let vs not thinke it too much, and murmur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our phisition, who knoweth better then wee, what medicine is fittest for the curing of our diseases: neither let vs say that others haue worse soares, and more gentle salues; more dangerous sicknesses, and more easie reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; for if wee are often mistaken in our bodily diseases, and thinke that wee are in no perill, when the Phisition seeth that our sickenes is almost desperate, and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, rest not vpon our owne feeling, but vpon his skill, and willingly take that which hee prescribeth; then how much more may wee bee deceiued in the sicknesses of our soules; thinking our dāgerous diseases, to be but smal infirmities; &amp; deepe consumptions in grace but some little distemper, &amp; faint languishing; &amp; therefore how much rather should we referre our selues wholy to the skill and wisedome of God, who cannot erre for want of iudgement, because he knoweth all things, nor for want of care, because his loue is infinite, patiently drinking a more bitter potion, then wee see prouided for others, who outwardly seeme more dangerously sicke, because wee may bee assured, that either our Phisition seeth our
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:10735:185"/> diseases inwardly to be more perilsome, and therefore neede sharper medicines; or that wee are of greater strength, and therefore better able to brooke their bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse? And when we find and feele that our heauenly father doth diuersly chastise his children, some with fewer and lighter, and others with more and harder stripes; and that wee haue our part among those who haue the greatest measure, let vs know that he corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth diuers faults, and that in those who are of a diuers nature. Some faults are lesser, either in themselues, or as they are extenuated with circumstances, and are with little adoe left and amended; some are greater, either in their owne nature, or as they are by circumstances ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauated, and are not forsaken without great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Some sinnes are like the cloke or vpper garment, easily shaken off, without any trouble to him who lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them aside, and some cleaue to our corrupt nature like the skinne to the flesh, or the flesh to the bones, and cannot be parted from vs without great paine in the parting: of those we may be reformed with the least word or lightest correction, but of these not without many stripes and bitter paine. Againe, the children of God whom he chastiseth, are of diuers natures and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions; one is milde and gentle, and is easily rebuked with an angry word, another is so sturdy and stomack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that he will not be reformed with many blowes; one needeth no more but the shadow or shaking of the rodde, and he is presently humbled, and beggeth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don with promise of amendment; but vnto another the smart of the rod is not sufficient, but he needeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a whip to pull downe his stomack, and to make his stout heart to yeeld and relent. And therefore seeing there is such great diuersitie both in faults committed, and natures who offend, it is no great maruaile if Gods chastisements be also diuers. Neither dooth it follow hereupon, that the greatest measure or hardest stripes
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:10735:185"/> exceed necessitie, or be more then needs. For our most wise Father, in his corrections resolueth to reforme all his children, and to free them from the greatest, as well as from the least sins, as well from those which they are most in loue with, and loathest to leaue, and from which they part with greatest paine and difficulty, as from them with which being in least league and liking, they are willing to leaue at the first admonition. And when he taketh vs in hand, he will maister the proudest heart and stoutest stomacke, as wel as that which is milde and gentle; and for this end if fewer and lighter stripes will not serue the turne, he wil inflict more and harder, neuer ceasing till he haue throughly humbled vs, brought vs vpon our knees, and made vs to promise reformation and amendment; because if he giue ouer before he haue att<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And so likewise the people glorified God, both in flying vnto him by prayer in their distresse, as vnto their only refuge; and also being freed, by singing vnto him songs of thanksgiuing for their great deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.

An example whereof we haue in the holy Apostles, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced in their afflictions and persecutions, because they were thought worthy to suffer for the name of Christ.<note place="margin">2.

For well may we with comfort and patience yea with ioy and thanksgiuing suffer afflictions that his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly name may be glorified; seeing he hath been content to suffer much more grieuous punishments in the whole course of his life, as hunger thirst, wearinesse, persecution the wrath of God and death it selfe, that he might by his sufferings procure our glory; well may we reioice and triumph in our momentany and light afflictions which aduance the glory of our redeemer, who hath deliuered
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:10735:191"/> vs by his death and obedience from the intollerable and euerlasting torments of hell fire: especially considering, that this was the end of his paying so great a price for vs, that being bought, we might become his seruants, and he our Lord, whom we are to glorifie in all we doe or suffer. For so the Apostle saith, <hi>that Christ therefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom, 14 9.</note>
                  <hi>and rose againe and reuiued, that he might be Lord both of the dead and the quicke,</hi> and that we are predestinate vnto eternall happinesse in Christ, that trusting in him we should be to the praise of his glory; and finally that he<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 12. 14.</note> purchased the possession of heauenly felicity for vs, not only to glorifie vs, but that we also might aduance his praise and glory. To conclude this point, the Lord is our <hi>summum bonum,</hi> and chiefe happinesse, and his glory is the supreme end of all things. In regard whereof we are to reioice in our afflictions which tend to the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his glory, seeing thereby we attaine vnto our chiefe end. Yea we should desire rather in this respect to be excluded out of the ioyes of heauen, and to perish e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlastingly;<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 31.</note> then that Gods glory vnto which all things are destinated, as vnto their chiefe end, should be blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed or impaired: as we may see in the example of <hi>Moses</hi> who rather then he would haue the name of God disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored among the nations in the destruction of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Israell, desired to be rased out of the booke of life.<note place="margin">Exod. 32. 32.</note> As also in the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> who in penning of the holy Scriptures by the immediate inspiration of Gods holy spirit, which priuiledged him from erring through blind and preposterous zeale, did earnestly wish to be an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema, or one separated from Christ, and the euerlasting ioyes of his kingdome, on this condition that God might be glorified in the saluation of the people of the<note place="margin">Rom 9. 3.</note> Iewes. And therefore if we ought to be content, though we should be depriued of euerlasting saluation, and be subiected vnto euerlasting punishments, that God may be glorified in vs; then how much more should we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure

For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, thus doth the Lord by afflictions make manifest the faith, affiance, hope, loue, patience, obedience, and such like graces, which hee hath bestowed vpon others, that wee admiring and louing them, may seeke and labour after them, and so carry our selues alike vertuously when wee come into the like trials; and as a man hauing ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a candle, doth not hide it in a hole, or as our Sauiour speaketh, put it vnder a bushell; but setteth it in a candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke, that by the light thereof, they of the family may bee guided, and directed; so the Lord hauing put into these chosen lampes, the oile of his graces, which being kindled with the fire of afflictions, doth giue a great and glorious light, he would not haue them to shine to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues alone, or to the Lord, who delighteth in their brightnesse, but hee placeth them like lights on a hill, which giue direction to all passengers, or like candles on a table for the vse and benefit of the whole family.

And another sayth, that the faithfull are afflicted to this end, because they are to be propounded as examples of patience for the benefit of all the rest: and as other of the faithfull are thus by their afflictions profitable vnto vs, so are we in ours alike profitable vnto others, if in the fiery triall, Gods graces, and the good vertues which we haue receiued do shine vnto them. For, if like spices we be punned in this morter of afflictions, the odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous smell of our spirituall graces, which before were scarce discerned, doth now spread abroad, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and refreshing of all that stand about vs; and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if like roses we grow vntouched, we doe but for the present send forth some sweet smell to those who are next vnto vs: contrariwise, if we be distilled with the fire of afflictions, we shall yeeld sweet waters of dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble comfort, euen to those who are farre distant, and such as liue in after-ages, when by report this sweet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of our fame shall come vnto them.

And as we haue this consolation by others, so haue our poore weake brethren the like by vs, when being adorned and well furnished with Gods gifts and graces, we doe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding in our afflictions bewray our weaknesse and frailty, whereas if they had only experience of their owne infirmities and imperfections, and could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the like in other of Gods seruants, whom they acknowledge indued richly with his graces, and nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble instruments of his glory, they would easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 5.

               <p>Moreouer, other of the faithfull haue much profit and benefit by our afflictions as they are occasioned
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:10735:196"/> hereby to acknowledge, prayse and magnifie Gods power appearing in our weaknes, his wisedome in our simplicity and feelinesse, and his goodnesse and the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his graces, in our frailty and naturall corruption; for when as they plainly see, that we who are weake and impotent of our selues, and ready to faint and fall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the lightest burthen, do neuerthelesse stand stoutly and couragiously in the greatest tentations▪ and vnder the heauiest waight of afflictions, they are forced to ascribe the glory to God, by whose power we are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported;<note place="margin">2.

And as when we see one of our friends and companions, whom we knew weake, impotent and vnskilfull in all feates of actiuity, wrast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with a mighty and cunning aduersary, we presently giue him ouer in our thoughts as foyled, shamed and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne; but if contrary to our expectation, hee foyle and cast downe his strong and skilfull enemy, we so triumph in his victory, as that wee giue the chiefe prayse vnto the master of the masteries, from whom he hath had his ability and cunning: so when we behold any of our brethren, whom we know to be naturally weake, impotent and impatient of the least paine, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating &amp; wrastling with our puissant enemie the world, who striueth might and maine to ouerthrow them, with those powerfull forces of miseries and afflictions, as we cannot but giue them ouer for vanguished, if we respect their owne skill and strength; so when contrary to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectation we see them get the victory, and ouerthrow their enemy; as we haue iust cause to applaude them and to reioyce in their conquest; so most of all, to prayse and magnifie the Lord, from whom alone they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued all their strength and skill.</p>
               <pb n="375" facs="tcp:10735:196"/>
               <p>Finally, others haue fruite and benefit by our affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,<note place="margin">Sect. 6. That by our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions we are made compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate and more ready and able to comfort others.</note> both because our harts are made tender by them, and apt to pittie those whom we see subiect to the like miseries; and also because after we are deliuered, we are able out of our owne experience to comfort them with those consolations wherewith we our selues haue beene comforted. For, in the former respect it may truly be sayd of pitie and mercy, as of loue and charity, that they begin at home; neither is euer a man so pitifull and mercifull vnto those whose case is miserable, as when himselfe hath beene pinched with the like miseries; nor is there any place in his heart for compassion of others griefes, till passion and suffering of the same euils haue beene there before. And for the other it may be affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with like truth▪ that there is no man so fit to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort others, as he who speaketh out of his owne expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, raising vp their deiected minds with those conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, wherwith himselfe hath formerly bin comforted and refreshed. For, as in the body, the same salue serueth for the some sore, and the same medicine for the same disease, though they be applied to diuers persons, so that respect be had to fit them to their strength, constitution, and temperature; and therefore no Phisition is more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to cure another man, then hee who hath first cured himselfe of the same disease; because vnto his art is ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned experience, whereby it is made perfect: so in the minde, the same consolations are most fit for the same crosses, so that there be a wise consideration of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position and spirituall constitution of the parties to whom they are applied. And therefore when we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to comfort others, can out of our owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence say, I my self haue been thus afflicted; and thus, and thus did I receiue consolation and was strengthened in patience to beare my crosses: These &amp; these great things did the Lord for me in the time of my trouble, thus did he strengthen me in my greatest weaknesse, and thus
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:10735:197"/> did he support me with his might, when being feeble in my selfe I was ready to faint and fall; thus was I refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with spirituall consolations and the inward fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Gods loue and mercy, and thus did he power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deliuer me, when in respect of all outward meanes my case was desperate. These comforts, as they will be in all likelihood more effectuall to cure a diseased mind, because they are approued by experience; so will the sicke patient more willingly take them, when he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that his Physition doth not try new conclusions out his art and theory, but doth practise out of his owne experience, prescribing the same medicine to his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, where with himselfe being so affected was lately cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And thus doth <hi>Dauid,</hi> being deliuered from his troubles comfort others out of the experience which he had of Gods mercies. <hi>I sought the Lord</hi> (sayth he)<note place="margin">Psal 34. 4, 5, 6</note>
                  <hi>and heheard mee, yea he deliuered me out of all my feare:</hi> and how effectually this would be for this vse, he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the words following; <hi>they shall looke vnto him and runne vnto him, and their faces shall not be ashamed, saying; this poore man cryed and the Lord beard him, and saued him out of all his troubles.</hi> The Apost. <hi>Paul</hi> sayth plainly, <hi>that God comforted him in all his tribulations, that hee might be able to comfort them who are in any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, by the comforts wherewith himselfe was comforted</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 1. 4.</note>
                  <hi>of God;</hi> and that he was afflicted for the consolation &amp; saluation of the Corinthians, which was wrought in the induring of the same sufferings which he also suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Yea, thus was the great Physition of our soules, Iesus Christ, the better inabled to raise vs, fainting in our infirmities, with the cordials of comforts, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing first in himselfe experience of our griefes and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: for as the Apostle sayth, <hi>in that he suffered and was</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 18</note>
                  <hi>tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.</hi> And therefore if Christ himselfe, as he was man and our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, though he were most exquisite in skill, had need

<pb n="378" facs="tcp:10735:198"/> as they induced much with patience for particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, so they wished to be out off and separated for the welfare and saluation of the whole Church.

The former of these two points is first to be proued, as being a paradox to the world and our corrupt flesh, who feare and fly from affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions as the greatest euills, and doe in no other respect mislike this life, but because it is obnoxious and subiect vnto them. And surely it cannot be denied but that these afflictions (as before I haue shewed) are in their owne nature euill, and that to wicked men they are exceeding hurtfull, seeing they thrust them into many tentations, and cause them to fall into many sinnes: they much vex and torment them both in their soules and bodies, and are vnto them the beginnings, and (as it were) the first flashes of their hellish tortures: but vnto the child of God and true beleeuer, their nature is changed, their sting of<note place="margin">Nulla no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And this commeth to passe chiefly and principally through the infinite wisedome and power of God, who taketh away the strength from this poison, and the hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sting from this serpent; and also through the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue

                  </note> point is the chiefe fountaine of all true comfort and consolation, and the want of this assurance is the cause of all impatience, murmuring, and complaining; I will the more largely insist vpon it; and will plainely proue, and by cleere euidence of truth demonstrate, that in all our afflictions &amp; chastisemēts, the Lord both intendeth our good, and also doth accordingly by his wisedome, power and prouidence, effect it and bring it to passe. To which purpose let vs consider, that God by our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions intendeth, and powerfully worketh our good, both in respect of this life and the life to come. In this life we haue much good by our afflictions whether wee
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:10735:203"/> consider them as trials, or as fatherly chastisements and corrections.</p>
               <p>Concerning the former we are to know, that the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions which we suffer are not alwaies chastisements for our sinnes, but sometimes gracious trials wherewith God trieth and tempteth vs for his owne glory and our owne good. And this may appeare both by testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Scriptures and by examples: For thus the Lord sayth, that he <hi>led his people forty yeeres in the Wildernesse,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 8. 2</note>
                  <hi>for to humble them and proue them, to know what was in their heart, whether they would keepe his commandements or no.</hi> So speaking of the remainder of his people, whom he did not vtterly cut off in iudgement, he sayth by the Prophet <hi>Zachary: I will bring that third part through the</hi>

                  <hi>hath he tried them, and receiued them as a burnt offering.</hi> And of this we haue many examples in the Scriptures: For thus the Lord excercising <hi>Abraham</hi> with that great affliction of offering vp his owne Sonne euen his <hi>Isaac,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 1</note> so dearely beloued, and the ioy of his heart, is sayd herein not to haue corrected <hi>Abraham</hi> for his sinnes, but only to haue proued him, that his faith and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

Thus the Lord tried <hi>Iob</hi> that by his afflictions, his faith, affiance and patience might be manifested, and that it might appeare to bee a slaunder, which Sathan laide to his charge; namely, that he serued God for rewards, and<note place="margin">Iob. 1 9. 10. 12.</note> not for loue, to which purpose <hi>Iob</hi> himselfe sayth, <hi>God knoweth my way and trieth me, and I shall come forth like</hi>

                  <hi>O God hast proued vs, and hast tried vs as siluer is tried.

<pb n="392" facs="tcp:10735:205"/> deiected with the sight of our naturall infirmities, wee are ready to make our estate desperate, to thinke that we are destitute of all grace, and vnable to stand in the least tentation. And therefore the Lord bringeth vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to these trials, that wee may come to a true estimate of that which is in vs, and neither ouerweene and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our giftes and good parts, to be thereby puffed vp in pride, through a conceit of our owne excellency; nor too much vilifie and vnder value the gifts and graces which we haue receiued of him, and so rob him of that glory and praise which is due vnto him. So that as one<note place="margin">Chrysost. in Math. 3.

And this<note place="margin">Miserum te iudico quod nunquam fuisti miser, transisti sine aduersario vitam.

               <pb n="393" facs="tcp:10735:205"/>
               <p>So also the Lord by these trials doth make vs knowne<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 4. That God by our afflictions maketh vs bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter known vnto others.</hi>
                  </note> vnto others, either discouering by them our graces or infirmities: For nothing is more common then to erre grosly in our iudgements, whilest we censure their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and good parts, we being easily deceiued, either by their outward shewes, because our weake and dull sight cannot pierce their secrets and inward parts; or by our owne affections, according as we ouermuch like, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the parties of whom we iudg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

So we vnder-valew some as cowardly, faint-hearted, and vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to beare any thing for the name of Christ, because they are of a still and quiet disposition, yea it may be ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous, in respect of that sense which they haue of their owne naturall frailty and weaknesse, who when they come to the fiery triall, doe proue more constant and couragious then others, who by their great bragges and confident speeches, haue possessed vs with an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their vndaunted magnanimitie, and immouea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:10735:206"/> constancy. Finally, we are apt to iudge some desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all patience, because in their naturall disposition they are inclined to anger and choller; when as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to this touch-stone of triall, they beare with much more meeknesse and contentednesse all their crosses and calamities, then others whose vntried patience we haue praised and extolled, whereas indeed they had neuer the true grace of patience, but some naturall mildnesse and quietnesse, which though it made a glittering and golden shew, yet (like drossie brasse) it flieth all into fitters, when it is brought to be tried vpon this anuile of afflictions. And therefore, that false shewes and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall shadowes, may not rob his substantiall vertues and sauing graces of their due esteeme and deserued commendation, God bringeth all to the touch-stone, and by pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

We all make profession that we are the children of God, though many in truth remaine still the seruants of sinne and slaues of sathan; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the lord, like the eagle, taketh all his yong eaglets, after that he hath for a time fed and nourished them in the nest of the Church, and maketh them to looke vpon the piercing beames of this sunne of affliction; that he may discouer and seuer the bastard broode whose weak sight indureth not this blazing brightnesse, from those who being true bred are able to behold it with vndaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led eies. We professe our selues to be gold fit for Gods treasury, and pure corne meet for the graners of eternall blessednesse: and yet there is among vs more drosse then gold, and more chaffe then wheat: and therefore the Lord casteth vs into the fiery furnace of affliction, that the pure mettall may be tried and in triall purified, and the drossie substance may be seuered, and in the separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion burned and consumed: and fanneth and winnoweth vs with the strong wind of tribulatiō, that the chaffe may be blowne away, and the pure corne remaine for his owne vse. We professe our selues trees well planted by Gods owne hand in his garden of grace, and that we are houses fit for his owne dwelling, which haue a good ground and sure foundation, euen the rock Iesus Christ: whereas in trueth there are many plants of the diuells setting, which haue no other hold but the weake and short roots of carnall ends and worldly respects: which are there planted by sathan, to hinder the growth, to sucke away the nourishment, and to shade and annoy, disorder and disgrace those fruitfull and choice trees of Gods owne grafting; and many houses which are not built vpon the rock Christ, but vpon the sands of humane

For as when we are winnowed with the wind of afflictions euery small blast is sufficient to separate &amp; driue away the chaffe from the wheat, so when a stronger gale bloweth, there is a second diuision made; for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the weaker and stronger christians remaine toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the same Church and communion, as it were in the same floore and heape, yet when any strong blast of tentation bloweth, those that are weaker in grace like the lighter corne, shake, stagger and flie somewhat back, whereas the stronger are not moued, but keep their place, like the purer wheat and waightier graine, with great constancy and vndanted courage. And thus doth the Lord trie our faith, and by these afflictions shew vs vnto what degree and measure of assurance we haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; for when it is weake and but of small growth, though we imagine with <hi>Peter,</hi> that we can walke vnto Christ vpon the deepe waters, yet if but a small waue of affliction arise and come against vs, we are through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity ready to sinke and perish, if Christ did not catch hold of vs; howsoeuer in selfe confidence and conceipt we are ready to boast with him, that though al the world should forsake Christ, we will not: yet when we come to the triall, the voice of a poore damsell is enough to quell all our courage▪ and to make vs shamefully flie backe and forsake our master. But when we are come vnto fulnes of perswasion, then are we ready to say with <hi>Paul,</hi> vnto those who disswade vs from bearing the crosse which God layeth vpon vs; <hi>what doe you weeping and breaking my heart, for I am ready not only to be bound,

For to shew our affection towards him, when being in prosperity we abound with his blessings, is no great matter; seeing we are hyred thereunto with the wages of worldly benefits, and doe therefore loue God because we first loue our selues, not for his owne sake, but because of his gifts and rewards: but if our loue continue in his wonted heat, when as God withdraweth this fuell of earthly plenty, and we imbrace him with ardent affection, when (as it were) he stoppeth our wages, or resumeth into his hands that which formerly he bestowed on vs: then will it plainly appeare, that we loue the giuer, better then his gifts, and that we find cause enough in God himselfe to vnite our hearts vnto him, though all these bands of earthly blessings be broken or taken away. Yea if the fire of affliction doe not lessen, but much intend and increase the heat of this our loue, and no danger seeme difficult into which God thrusteth vs▪ no burthen heauy which he laieth vpon vs; if (as it fared with <hi>Iacob</hi> being in loue with <hi>Rahel</hi>) many yeeres miseries do seeme but a few daies because we suffer them for his sake; yea if we are glad being assaulted with these enemies, to indure many wounds, to receiue many foiles, and sustaine much griefe and labour, that by these trialls we may shew our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and that loues triumph may be more glorious, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it hath obtained victory ouer so great forces; ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="400" facs="tcp:10735:209"/> cannot quench it, nor these flouds of afflictions coole or drowne it. And as the Lord by these afflictions<note place="margin">Chrysost. Math. cap. 3. Homil. 3.</note> sheweth how great the measure of our loue is towards him, so because the loue of him and the world are quite contrary, he doth by the same meanes discouer, how much we haue profited in the contempt of the world, and are weaned in our affections frō doting vpō it. For as the graine of come which is full &amp; ripe, &amp; is no sooner tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with the flaile but it presently flieth from the straw and empty eare, and if it be small and light is not beaten out, vnlesse it be with much more difficulty, but if it be altogether empty and vnripe it cannot with much thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing be seuered, but remaineth still in the straw, and is cast out or burnt with it: so those who adhere vnto worldly delights like the corn to the chaffe &amp; care, if they be ful of grace &amp; ripe in godlines, are with the least touch of this flaile of afflictions seuered from the loue of the world; and being vnited in their heart and affection vnto God, they flie vnto him; whereas if hauing begun to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace vertue and holinesse, they haue made as yet but small progresse, they are not weaned from these worldly vanities except they be much beaten with many crosses and calamities, but if they be quite empty of all grace and goodnesse, then doe they in their heart and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons sticke so inseparably fast vnto the things of this life, that though they be neuer so much beaten with afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and tribulations, yet they cannot be disioyned and parted, and so are cast out and reiected of God, perishing together with these transitory euills, because they will not be deuided from them. Finally God by these afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doth trie the measure of our patience, obedience and humility; for where there is no passion and suffering, there is no place for patiēce; where there is no difficulty danger or burthen to be vndergone, there is no triall of obedience; and when Gods will doth not crosse ours, euery man can shew humility and submission; but then
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:10735:209"/> our patience is manifested and magnified, when being vnder heauy crosses and calamities, we beare them with meeknesse and cheerfulnesse, without any murmuring and repining; then are we truely obedient, when with the Apostle, we can <hi>serue the Lord with all modesty, &amp; with</hi>

For as the starres do not appeare in the day time; but shine most brightly in the darkest night; so these glorious starres of Gods sauing graces, which were hardly discerned in the day of prosperity and worldly happinesse, do shine clearely, and (as it were) in their full strength, in the darke night of troubles and afflictions. And as in Maisteries, men healthfull, strong, and of good habitude and proportion of lims, doe not plainly appeare so to be, when hauing their garments on, they come marching in all their bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery, but when they haue stript themselues, and appeare naked on the Theater; then are the beholders most rapt with admiration, when nothing shadoweth or hideth the excellent proportion and strong making of all their parts and lims: euen so the inwarde graces and good
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:10735:210"/> parts of a Christian, are not so well discerned when the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of prosperity, the riches, honours and delights of this life doe shade and couer them, but when they are stript of all, and are with <hi>Iob</hi> brought to the theater to contend and striue with the aduersaries of our saluation, that they obtaining the victorie, may bee crowned with the garland of glory and happinesse; then all vailes and shadowes being taken away, the gifts and graces receiued from God doe appeare in their naked beautie, and then are the behoulders rauished, when they view their worth and excellency, which were neither discerned nor regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded whilest they were hid and couered.</p>
               <p>And thus the Lord trieth, and by triall discouereth,<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 8.

                  </note> both his gifts and the measure of them; chiefly and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally for his owne glory from whom we haue receiued them: for as the art of the shipwright appeareth when the ship brooketh all weathers, continueth firme and strong in al stormes and tempests, and say leth wel with all windes and in euerie sea; and as the cutlers and armorours skill is made manifest, not whilest the sword hangeth by the side in a veluet scabberd; or whilest the armour is cleane kept and well oiled in the armorie; but when the one is tried in fight, or by smiting the anuile or barre of iron; and the other in the field with the caliuer or musket shot: so these workes of Gods spirit, these sanctifying and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing graces, doe then most commend their workmaster, when they come to be tried in this sea of miseries, and with these bullets of tentation; for if they then hould out, and neither leake nor sinke, and being neither peirced, nor much battered, do preserue vs from all outward violence in this combate against our spirituall enemies, then the wisedome and skill, power and bountie of God, who both made and gaue them, doth clearely shine and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly appeare. And as the Lord the donor of these gifts and graces is glorified in the triall of them, so we the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, comming by these meanes to the knowledge and
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:10735:210"/> sight of them, haue in our selues much more ioy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and are more highly valued and esteemed in others iudgements, when these rich treasures and vnualuable Iewels of Gods sauing graces are discouered vnto them: which if they were not thus tryed would be obscured, and lye hid both to them and vs. To this purpose one saith▪ that to be alwaies in a prosperous estate: and to passe all a mans time without any vexation of mind, is to remaine ignorant of the one halfe of nature and humaine affaires: thou maiest be a man of magnanimious spirit, but how shall I know it, if thou neuer haue occasion to shew thy<note place="margin">Senec. de Prou. cap. 4.</note> vertue? thou commest into the theater to striue for maste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: but there commeth no aduersarie to contend with thee, thou maiest well haue the prize, but not the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. And againe; how shall I know with what patienco thou canst beare pouertie, if thou doest alwaies abound in riches? how shall I discerne what heart and courage thou hast to indure shame, infamie, and popular hatred, if thou wax old in vulger applauses, &amp; the stream of their fauours flow vnto thy graue? how shall I know with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie and contentednesse thou couldest sustain the losse of thy children, if all, which haue beene borne vnto thee, are still in thy sight? well may I heare thee whilest thou art comforting others: but then only I truely see and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne thee, when thou giuest comfort vnto thy selfe, and commandest thy griefes to auoide thy presence. He that would know the skill of the Pilate must not looke on him lying quietly on his bed in a safe port: nor sayling in a faire sea, with a prosperous winde: but when he is in the middest of syrts and sands, tossed &amp; indangered with boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous stormes and cruell tempests, then to quit his ship and selfe out of these perils, and to bring it safe into the wished hauen, argueth the greatnesse of his skill, and gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth him the reputation of a cunning mariner.

And therefore the Lord bringeth vs into a sea of miseries, and tosseth vs with the tempest of tentations, that by well acquitting our selues in these perils, our skill, wherewith he hath indued vs, may be manifested and approued. He suffereth vs not in this christian warfare to lye at ease in garrison, but bringeth vs into the field, and suffereth many and strong enemies to incounter vs; that demeaning our selues manfully in this fight, he our graund captain may haue the chiefe glorie, &amp; we that due approbatiō &amp; praise, which of right belongeth to our courage and fortitude.

               <p>Yea wilt thou say, but my afflictions are great, and<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 4. They answered who obiect the greatnes of their trials, and smalnesse of their strēgth▪</hi>

Or if he haue knowledge and wisedome enough, canst thou doubt of his will, seeing he hath bound himselfe by a most gracious promise, that he will not suffer vs to be tempted or tried aboue our power and strength, but<note place="margin">1.

Yea, but in the meane time thou art pressed with such an heauy waight, that thou bewrayest thine infirmities and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions. And happely it is necessary and profitable for thee so to do, that by this triall thou mightest come
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:10735:215"/> to the sight and sense of these corruptions and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections which before were in thee, though hidden and vnknowne, to the end, that now beholding them, thou maist be truly humbled, brought to vnfained repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to an hearty indeuour in all, vsing all good means to be cleansed and freed from them. And thus it is necessary that the drosse of our corruptions should be discerned, that it may be purged away, and we purified; and that our secret diseases should be discouered, that we might be cured and freed from them. It may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, that the Lord letteth thee bewray in these trials of afflictions, thy lesser corruptions of immoderate griefe and impatiencie, to free thee from such sinnes as are much more hainous and enormious; as from pride, self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loue, and carnall confidence, whereby we robbe God of his glory to magnifie our selues, and our soules of all sound comfort, seeing our greatest strength being weaknesse and impotencie, must needs faile vs when we most rely vpon it. In wonderful mercy and loue therfore doth the Lord deale with thee, if by these trials he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth thee to bewray thy smaller infirmities, that he may free thee from grosser sinnes, mortifie thy hellish pride, and decke thee with that excellent ornament of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; taking away all selfe confidence in thine owne strength, doe cause thee with full affiance to rest vpon him, who will neuer fayle those who trust in him.</p>

<pb n="413" facs="tcp:10735:215"/> spirituall graces (like those in the Arke) arise and mount vp with them, triumphing ouer these seas of miserie with comfort and reioycing, which ouerwhelme and drowne others, who sticke fast vnto earthly helps, with sorrow and heauinesse. Neither is it to bee imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that the Lord who best knoweth our strength, because hee made vs, and hath approoued his infinite loue towards vs, because hee hath with so inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a price redeemed vs, will in trying destroy vs, or lay vpon vs a burthen which will ouerwhelme vs; yea rather we may assure our selues, that where he hath laid the heauiest loade, there hee hath giuen the greatest strength, and where there is aboundance of afflictions, there he bestoweth abundance of patience, faith and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther graces, whereby they may be inabled to beare and ouercome them. We see that the wise commander im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth his souldiers, according to that opinion which he hath of their worth and valour; and when hee hath some daungerous and hie exploit to be atchieued, hee doeth not make choise of fresh-water and white-liuerd souldiers, but of such as are of most magnanimious spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and fullest of courage, valour and approued for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>

And finally, the wise lapidary bringeth not his tender christall, or softer stones, to be tried by the stithy and hammer, but the hard Adamant which wil rather bruise the iron and steele, then be broken by their blowes. And
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:10735:216"/> therfore, if there be this wisedome and care to be found in men, let vs certainly conclude that the Lord, infinite in wisedome and loue, doth much more fit his trials to the strength of his children, whose good &amp; wel-fare he so much tendereth, choosing out his most valorous soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, for the strongest incounters, his best schollars, for the hardest lessons, his choisest armours for the highest proofe, and hammering none vpon the Anuile of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but such as he hath made of adamantine hardnesse, to beare without breaking all these blowes.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Abraham,</hi> the father of the faithfull, hauing at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained vnto fulnesse of perswasion &amp; assurance, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised with the strongest tentation, euen the sacrificing of his deare <hi>Isaac</hi> with his owne hands.

And the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> abounding in the riches of Gods spiritual gifts, and going beyond all the rest of his ranke, in care and labours for the glory of God, and good of his Church, did as farre exceede them all in crosses and trials.

               <p>And finally where there is no grace or goodnesse,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:10735:216"/> there may well bee inflicted deserued punishments of sinne, but no triall in this conflict of afflictions. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may wee thinke that those who are not exercised with these crosses, are more highly in Gods fauour then other men, seeing the Apostle telleth vs, <hi>that God scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth euery sonne whom he receiueth,</hi> and they who are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 6</note> from these corrections, <hi>of which all are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> are bastards and not sonnes. Nor may we imagine that our wise Commaunder in loue spareth these men whom he neuer calleth out to the fight; but rather reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth and excludeth them out of his campe, the Church militant; either because hee knoweth them to bee such dastardly Cowards, as will flee from, or yeeld to the weakest enemies; or such rebels and traitors, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther professedly or in their hearts ioine with sathan, and the world, against him and his holy army.

And lastly, he will honour vs by crowning his graces in vs, when as by tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all they are approoued: Euen as the skilfull Armourer, first graceth his armour by good workmanship, then by bringing it to the proofe; and lastly by causing it to be emploied in the Princes seruice; or as the Generall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth the souldier, first, by training him to the wars, and making him expert in all feates of chiualry, then by giuing him a place of imployment fit for his giftes and good parts; and finally by rewarding and crowning his victories, causing him to sit with himselfe in his chariot of triumph.</p>
               <p>As therefore the valiant souldier murmureth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Captaine, when hauing an high opinion of his worth and magnanimious fortitude, he appointeth him to high attempts and seruices, full of danger and difficulty, but accounteth himselfe much honoured, in that he thinketh him worthy of such imployments: and contrariwise, thinking his valour and abilities vnderua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, is ful of discontent, if he should be appointed vnto base and easie seruices, which any coward or fresh-water souldier could atchieue without difficulty or danger: So, much lesse haue we any cause of repining, when our great Commaunder, who best knoweth our abilities, doth imploy vs in seruices of an high nature; yea rather we haue cause of thanksgiuing and reioycing, seeing he hath first honoured vs with gifts fit for these attempts, and now honoureth vs by giuing vs opportunity of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying them, and approouing them in the triall, and will hereafter crowne vs with victorie; neither doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his souldiers perish in their magnanimious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, seeing he protecteth them in all dangers, and neuer matcheth them with any enemy, but such as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableth them to ouercome.

<pb n="419" facs="tcp:10735:218"/> effecteth the good and benefit of his children, and that both spirituall and also earthly. The Lord by these crosses and calamities which he sendeth, much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanceth our spirituall good, in that he ordinarily vseth them as powerfull helpes and meanes, for the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of both our effectual calling, and sound conuersion, and also our sanctification and regeneration. For, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as naturally Gods elect doe in their hearts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons adhere vnto the world and the things of this life, like the good graine to the chaffe and straw, and, if they were not seuered, would perish with them; the Lord by these crosles doth weane them from these earthly vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and with the flaile and fanne of afflictions dooth make a separation between them, choosing, culling, and setting apart his Elect for his owne seruice, that they may be saued, and leauing the rest like light and refuse corne, to adhere stil vnto their carnall delights, till they perish in them. Whereas (like young Prodigals) whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest we haue the world at will, we runne away from our heauenly Father, and abuse the portion of his giftes in wanton and riotous courses, to his dishonour, and our owne vtter ruine &amp; destruction: When we are brought into misery and affliction, and desire, at least, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and releiue our selues with the huskes and swill of worldly and carnall pleasures, but cannot haue them, then are we brought to make a stand in our former loose courses, and begin to thinke of returning to our Father.</p>
               <p>And this purpose of God, in afflicting his loose and dissolute children, that he may conuert and turne them from their wicked waies vnto himselfe, he doth nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly set forth vnto vs in the Prophecy of <hi>Hosea: I will</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Esay. 17. 7</note>
                  <hi>of Israell.</hi> And in this regard the Psalmist out of a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall charitie towards his enemies, preferring their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall saluation before their worldly estate, prayeth<note place="margin">Psal. 83. 16</note> thus in their behalfe: <hi>Fill their faces with shame, that they may seeke thy name, O Lord.</hi> For it fareth with vs as it doth with foolish children; for if our heauenly Father should continually cocker vs, and neuer crosse vs of our wills and earthly desires, we would in wantonnesse and insolency forget and neglect him, casting his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements with proude contempt behinde our backes; wheras when he intermixeth seuerity with loue, frowns with smiles, and chastisements with his benefits, then no sooner doth he estrange himselfe from vs, abusing our liberty to licentiousnesse, and his gifts to his dishonour, but we presently returne, labour to amend our former errors, and seeke his face and fauour, with the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or renuing of his blessings and benefits. To this purpose one sayth, that God almighty doth two wayes wound those whom he purposeth to saue and cure; for sometimes he smiteth the flesh, and mollifieth the heart<note place="margin">Gregor. Mor. lib. 6. cap. 18</note> with his seare, he woundeth vs that he may recall vs, (when wee goe astray) into the way of saluation, and outwardly afflicteth our bodies, that our soules may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:10735:219"/> liue &amp;c. He killeth that he may quicken them, and hurteth that he may heale them: for therefore he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteth externall stripes, that he may inwardly cure their wounds of wickednesse. And sometimes ceasing to scourge vs outwardly, he doth inwardly afflict vs in soul and spirit, correcting and crossing the hardnes of our hearts with it owne desires, and vnruly passions; but by wounding he healeth them, whilst piercing them with the dart of his feare, he inlightneth them with the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and knowledge of the right way, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>An example hereof we haue in the Israelites of whom the psalmist saith, <hi>that when the Lord slew them, they sought</hi>

                  <hi>him, and they returned and enquired early after God, &amp;c.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> saith thus of them; <hi>O Lord in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they haue visited thee, they haue powred out a praier when thy chastning was vpon them.</hi> And this is vsuall to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued in the hystory of the Iudges and Kings, that when this people abounded in worldly prosperity, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke the Lord and serued idolls; but when he afflicted them sharply for such apostacy, then they were brought to a sight of their sinnes, they turned vnto the Lord, and repented and humbled themselues before him. Thus the Nineuites, who by their sinnes, committed in their pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, deserued an vniuersall destruction, when God threatned his iudgements against them, turned vnto the Lord with fasting, weeping and praier. So <hi>Manasses,</hi> who in his flourishing estate had forsaken the Lord, <hi>when he was in tribulation praied to the Lord his God, and humbled</hi>

                  <hi>himselfe greatly before the God of his fathers.</hi> And <hi>Saul,</hi> who raged against Gods Saints, when he was throwne<note place="margin">Act 9. 5.</note> downe to the earth and depriued of his sight, he doth in the time of his blindnesse, seeke and find the Lord, who ran away from him whilst he had the vse of his eies, when blinded inwardly with an ignorant zeale, he thought to approach neerest vnto him. To this purpose one saith, that God hath chosen them whom the world despiseth,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:10735:220"/> because commonly when men are contemned of the world they come hereby to the sight and knowledge of<note place="margin">Gregor. Homil. 36. in Luc. 14.</note> themselues. He that left his father, and spent his portion in riotous courses, returned vnto him when he was pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with hunger, and if he had not hungred he had not returned, for when he felt the wāt of earthly things, then he began to thinke of his spirituall losses. So when those who had oxen, farmes, and wiues, refused being inuited to come to the supper; the poore, weake, blind and lame became willing guests at the first call, because those who<note place="margin">Math. 22.</note> are impotent and despised in the world doe so much the more cheerfully heare the word of God, because they haue no earthly delights to distract and hinder them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the flesh which is as a notable pull-back, hindreth our conuersion and turning vnto God, whilst we enioy the world at will, and prosper in our euill courses, doth giue way vnto the part regenerate, when it is pinched with crosses and afflictions, that it may by this meanes be freed from present smart, and as the resty horse, or the refractory and sturdy oxe, doe not only, not draw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, but also pull backe and hinder their yoke-fellow, gauling and hurting them with their strugling and stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing; but when they feele the smart of the whip, or the pricke of the goade, they goe on forward, and helpe in the draught: so our flesh and vnregenerate part, doth hinder the spirituall man in all religious courses, gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and vexing it, when it would goe forward in the waies of godlinesse; but when it is whipped and pricked for this reluctation and backwardnesse, to be freed from paine, it is content to yeeld to an outward reformation, to turne vnto God, and to performe that seruice vnto him, in formality and hypocrisie, which the regenerate part performeth in sincerity and truth. Yea it selfe alone is ready to make a fained conuersion, to auoide smart and punishment, euen when there is no dramme of Gods spirit to helpe it forward, meerly out of selfe loue, and
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:10735:220"/> not the true loue of God: as we may see in the fained hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation of <hi>Ahas,</hi> when he heard Gods iudgements de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced<note place="margin">1.

               <p>But this will better appeare if wee consider the<note place="margin">Sect. 3.

And therefore the Lord, when wee dote vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these earthly idols, and will not bee estranged from them, doth set betwene vs and them the thorny hedge<note place="margin">Hos, 2. 6. 7.</note> of afflictions, (as hee speaketh by the Prophet) that being by this forcible meanes seperated from them, and pricked with tribulations, when we seek after them to renew our loue, wee may at last returne vnto him our true and first husband, because, when we serue him, our condition will bee much better, then whilest wee adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the world, when wee heare from it nothing but threatnings, and terrours, we are more willing to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto Gods sweete and gratious promises. And when with Elias wee haue hard and seene, yea also haue felt and hard our share, in the stormy tempest of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,<note place="margin">1.

               <p>The other meanes of our conuersion is our contrition and humiliation, of which as the chiefe cause is Gods<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 4.

And whereas naturally we are so blinded with selfeloue, that we doe not see our sinnes, and so puffed vp with pride, that we will not cast down our selues before God, and acknowledge and confesse them, when our eies are

And so much the more desperately is the mind of sinfull man blinded, by how much the lesse he discerneth the damage of his blindnesse.

And as they are an hedge of thornes to keep vs from companying and feeding with the Buls of Bashan, euen wicked worldlings in the fields of iniquity; so also are they hedges &amp; wals of defence, to preserue vs from the assaults of our spiritual enemies, and to keep them aloofe, when as otherwise they would

And surely this is a maine end why God afflicteth vs, not because we haue former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sinned, but that we may not sin for the time to come; not to punish vs because we haue committed it, but to preuent vs, that we be not againe ouertaken by it.

And thus the Lord taketh away from his children worldly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, when he seeth that they would by them be puft vp with pride, and become insolent and vaine-glorious: thus hee depriueth them of riches, when they would be vnto them thornes, to choake and hinder the growth of his heauenly graces, or prouocations, and incitements vnto sinne, or the meanes and instruments to further them in wicked actions, or like camels bunches hinder them from entring into the straite gate, which leadeth vnto happinesse. Thus hee taketh from vs parents, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and deare friends, when as (if we should still inioy them) we would make them our idols, setting our hearts vpon, louing, or trusting in them, more then in God himselfe. So he depriueth vs of our earthly pleasures, when he seeth that we would preferre them before hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly ioyes; and causeth vs to finde many troubles, cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and afflictions in the world, because hee knoweth, that if it should smile and fawne vpon vs, wee would make a paradise of the place of our pilgrimage, set our hearts and affections vpon these transitory trifles, and neuer care to trauell in the way of holinesse and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse which leadeth to our heauenly country. As therefore the wise and skilfull Physicion, doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apply medicines for the curing of diseases, when men are fallen into them, and restoratiues to repaire their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caied strength &amp; to recouer their health; but also in time of infection, and when they see some distemper in them through the abounding of humours, doe giue whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some preseruatiues, and preuenting purges, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine health, &amp; to driue away the approaching disease: so doth our heauenly Physicion vse these potions of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,

For; as if we be left vnto our selues, and be neither terrified from sinne by sense of our owne cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements, nor the terrour of others punishments, the vnregenerate part will grow so carnally secure, and proudly insolent, that it will tempt, yea pull and dragge vs into much wickednesse: to which purpose the wise man sayth of professed worldlings; that <hi>because sentence</hi>

For as the spirituall man feareth only spirituall punishments, and contemneth carnall; as namely, the curse of the law, the wrath of God, the last iudgement, and hell torments; but not famine, sword, the racke or gibbet. So the flesh and part vnregenerate feareth only these corporall punishments, and neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth those which are spirituall and eternall: whereof it is that they who are wholly carnall, doe vtterly despise all threatnings of spirituall iudgements, and run on in a headlong course of sinne, vnlesse they bee bridled and restrained with bodily punishments. And therefore the Lord knowing this, inflicteth vpon his seruants
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:10735:225"/> these outward crosses, that thereby hee may curbe in their carnall concupiscence from lusting after euill, from which if the vnregenerate part were throughly secured, it would be so importunate, and audacious in assaulting and tempting them vnto sinne, that if it did not wholly vanquish them, yet it would often foil them with these in counters, or at lest continually trouble them and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbe their peace.</p>

               <p>And thus it appeareth that the Lord in our afflictions

To which purpose he prescribeth vs a long fast, after fulnes, and appointeth vs a strict diet, causing vs to vse sparingly, or totally to abstaine from worldly delicates, whereon formerly we haue surfeted, or because wee cannot rule our appetite, hee doth out of his loue &amp; care take them from vs, and as it were locketh them out of our sight.</p>

<pb n="439" facs="tcp:10735:228"/> of the worser part, the better and more noble may be mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to seeke after the curing of it spiritual diseases. Though we are much indaungerd by our inward impostumes of sinne and corruption, so long as we are at ease, and in our outward estate in good plight and liking, we neuer looke for helpe and remedy; but when rankling and festring in our terrified consciences and afflicted spirits, they put vs to grieuous paine and intollerable torment, then do we sue and seeke vnto our heauenly Surgeon, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that hee should not onely apply vnto vs, the healing plaisters of his mercies, but also the sharpe corrasiues of crosses and afflictions; yea, that he should cut and launch, binde and seare vs, that by this present paine, wee may be freed from euerlasting torment.</p>
               <p>Finally, though our sinnes and corruptions, like filthy Sodomites, doe vexe our righteous soule and regenerate part dwelling with them, through their impiety; yet so are we made drunken with their sweete delights, and allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the bewitching pleasures which do accompany them, that we are loath, euen when God commaundeth vs, to leaue their society, if we were not pulled from them with a diuine violence, and as it were forced to flee from them, by this fire of afflictions.</p>
               <p>But as our crosses and calamities serue notably for the mortifying of all sinnes, so more especially these sinnes<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 6. That God by afflictions mortifieth our pride, carnall concupiscence, and selfe-loue.</hi>
                  </note> of pride, carnall concupiscence, selfe-loue, and loue of the world; for whereas in the time of our prosperity, we are apt not only to magnifie our selues, and to haue a great opinion of our worth and excellencie, but haue also the applause of others to puffe vs vp, which maketh pride to goe with full sayles, hauing got so faire a gale of vulgar breath and the wind of vaine glory to blow it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: when we are in aduersity and affliction▪ we are as much humbled and cast downe in our owne conceit, as in the opin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And thus <hi>Elihu</hi> saith, <hi>that God openeth the eares of men by their</hi>

The like also may bee sayd of selfe-loue, the heate whereof is exceedingly cooled and abated with troubles and afflictions; for howsoeuer, when we are adorned with worldly orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and curiously painted with the false colours of prosperity, like vaine women we admire our counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait beauty, and like the young fonling, wee dot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

An example whereof wee haue in <hi>Iob,</hi> who though he were but too much in loue with his owne worth and excellency in his prosperity, as may appeare by his discourses in the time of his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, wherein he complaineth that this smart exceeded his sin, and iustifieth himselfe with some impeachment to Gods infinite righteousnesse; yet when at length he was throughly humbled, his selfe-loue is turned into<note place="margin">Iob. 42. 6</note> loathing, and abhorring himselfe, he repenteth in dust and ashes.<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 7.

Yea so are we fixed and fastned, and (as it were) glued, nailed and riuetted vnto them, that whilest we securely enioy our carnall loue, and haue the full fruition of our worldly desires, we might as easily be perswaded, to pull the skin from our flesh, or the flesh from our bones, as to weane our affections from this bewitching strumpet. Now this worldly loue is such a dangerous sicknesse, that if wee were not cured of it, it would bring vs at last to a des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate consumption in all grace and goodnesse, and to euerlasting death both of body and soule; for faith in God, and confidence in earthly things, will not stand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, we cannot serue God and Mammon, we cannot loue the Lord and loue the world: for, (as the Apostle sayth) <hi>the amity of the world, is the emnity of God, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer</hi>

               <p>And therefore the Lord in infinite mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 8. That the Lord in great mercy sendeth affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to weane vs from the loue of the world.</hi>

For, though with <hi>Iacob</hi> we were spent with cares, and worne with labours, yet we could be content to dwell stil with this worldly <hi>Laban</hi> for the base hire of earthly vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and though he often deceiue vs of our wages, and promise that which hee neuer mindeth to pay, yet so long as he speaketh vs faire and fawneth vpon vs, wee neuer thinke of leauing his companie; and therefore the Lord causeth this Churle to change his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, to turne his smiles into frownes, his flattery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

And therfore the Lord suffereth the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and these worldly Aegyptians to rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs, to spoile vs of our goods, rob vs of our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and to oppresse and weare vs out with vnrewarded labours, that wee may grone and cry vnto the Lord for deliuerance earnestly desire that glorious liberty of the sonnes of God, and trauell more cheerfull towards the holy land: we adhere to the world with our hearts and affections, like the wheare in the eare, to the chaffe and straw, and if wee were let alone, would neuer part with it, till we were both consumed in the furnace of Gods wrath; and therefore the Lord in loue and mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs thrasheth vs with afflictions, that hee may se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate vs from it, and preserue it from perishing. And as the nursing mother, being with childe, desireth to wean her sucking infant from her hurtfull and vnwholsome milke; and for the effecting of it, thinketh it in vaine, in respect of the childs fondnesse and small vnderstanding, to vse only reasons to disswade it from the breast, or to tell it, that her milke is vn wholsome and will breed dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, but rather layeth mustard or worme-wood vpon the teate, the bitternesse where of hee no sooner tasteth, but he beginneth to loath his former loue, and though he wanteth the vse of reason, yet is taught by sense to leaue that which is so distastfull: so the Lord intending to weane vs fondlings from worldly delights, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:10735:232"/> it is not enough (in regard of our childish dotage, found affection and small wit) to tel vs by his word what manifold mischiefes accompany our foolish loue; hee doth therefore embitter these pappes of pleasure with the worme-wood of afflictions, and so intermixeth with miseries our carnall delights, that though reason will not rule vs, yet at least by our sense and taste, wee may be moued to loath these earthly vanities.</p>

Yea, (wilt thou say) but my sinnes are not so great, nor my sores so incurable, that I should neede such sharpe remedies and grieuous afflictions to bee freed from them▪ I answere, that thy Iudge is able to discerne of the greatnesse of thy faults, and thy Physition of the disease, better then thy selfe who beeing a party and Patient, art blinded with selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loue, and partiall in thy iudgement. Either then thy sinnes are in their owne nature heinous, or are aggraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by circumstances, being committed against know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and conscience, or exemplary to the scandall of others; they are great in themselues, or through the hardnesse of thy heart, hard to be cured, or being small alone, they are not small to thee; seeing thou wilt by no meanes part with them, but resoluest still to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in them. For, as a man holdeth fast in his hand a smal staff, when as a great post is easily pulled from him: So do we oftentimes retaine our lesser sins with greater pertinacy, then our more hainous offences, and so make them grieuous by our persisting in them, which were more light in their owne nature. Neither is there any thing that doth more aggrauate our sins in the sight of God, then when they are ioyned with impenitency, and

Yea sometimes it commeth to passe, that afflictions like a cloude doe hide out of our sight the bright beames of these spirituall graces, and these miseries and calamities, like ashes, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:10735:239"/> these shining and burning coales of Gods sauing gifts, so as neither their heat nor light is discerned by the outward sense, but whilst they hide them, they also preserue them, which otherwise would be more subiect to wasting and going out, if they did lie open to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward aire of worldly prosperity.</p>
               <p>Yea these troubles and calamities doe not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme<note place="margin">Sect. 2. That afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do not only preserue and confirme, but also increase and multiply in vs Gods sauing graces.</note> and preserue in vs Gods spirituall graces, but also doe (as I sayd) increase and multiply them. For these ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seeds of Gods sauing gifts doe become most fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full when as they are pinched with the frost of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and this heauenly fire of sanctifying grace doth much increase both in heat and brightnesse, when the wind of tribulation doth blow vpon it. And this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe, both because the Lord is then most willing to bestow vpon vs these rich treasures of grace and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, when by these crosses and calamities we are fitted to receiue them, and also because we then aboue all times, most earnestly desire to be thus spiritually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched, when as we are impouerished in worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and vtterly spoiled of all earthly delights. For the Lord will not cast the seed of his graces into the ground of our hearts, before they are prepared to receiue them. And as the wise husband man will not hazard his wheat by sowing it in all kinds of land, but maketh choise of that which is fittest, and then ploweth, falloweth, and harroweth it, that it may be the better prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the seede: so much lesse will the Lord sow that much more precious graine of his sauing graces, in the stony and thorny hearts of wicked worldlings, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth choise only of his elect, which being made good grounds by his alone goodnesse, and the sole sun-shine of his grace and fauor; he first prepareth them for this holy seed by plowing, breaking vp and harrowing of their hearts full of naturall hardnesse, with troubles and afflictions, and then casteth it into them with a liberall
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:10735:240"/> hand. He will not giue his graces to the proud and lofty, who would contemne and despise them, but to the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; lowlie; and because our harts are naturally haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and exalted aboue measure, therefore the Lord first humbleth and presseth them downe with the waight of affliction, before he will giue vnto them this spirituall aduancement. He vouchsafeth these precious gifts vnto none, but them whose hearts are inlarged to receiue them, because such alone will esteeme them when they haue them; and whereas they are naturally streight, and haue this narrow roome, filled with carnall, and worldly loue, therefore he first emptieth them of this earthly trash by taking it from them, and then stretcheth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeth the heart in holy desires with troubles and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and so satisfieth and filleth them with his heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treasures. He will not giue these spirituall dainties to be fed vpon by full stomackes, seeing they would loath this diuine sweetnesse and be cloied with it: but he filleth the hungry with these good things, &amp; because we naturally want this appetite, he vsually getteth vs a stomacke and sharpneth our hunger, by withholding from vs all worldly delicates, and by appointing vs to feed on the bread of affliction and water of sorrow. And as the Lord most willingly giueth his spirituall graces to those, who are by afflictions and tribulations fitted to receiue them: so do they who are in this afflicted estate, aboue all others, esteeme these precious gifts, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly desire, and with all diligence vse the meanes to attaine vnto them: for when by our afflictions wee are so humbled that we become nothing in our selues, then do we most earnestly desire, that God by his grace and holy spirit may bee in vs all in all; when by calamities we are emptied of all earthly consolations, then do we most eagerly hunger after these spirituall comforts: when we are dispoiled of worldly riches, honours, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, health, strength and the rest; then do we most co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:10735:240"/> to bee inriched with that chiefe riches of Gods sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing graces which can neuer be taken from vs, and with great diligence seeke them from God by prayer, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the word, and vsing all other good meanes for the satisfying of our holy desires with vnwearied cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>And thus doe the faithfull, like painfull Bees, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the greatest store of this sweet hony of Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, out of the bitter thime of trouble and affliction; and grow most rich in God when they are most impoueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in the world.

                  </note> sake consider these graces as they respect God, or else our neighbours and our selues: The graces which respect God, are either seated in the vnderstanding mind and intellectuall part, or in the heart, will and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, or in both together; or else the fruits of them all, appearing in our vnfeined repentance and new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; all which are either confirmed and preserued, or else increased and multiplied by our troubles and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. The graces which are seated in our minde and
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:10735:241"/> vnderstanding, are knowledge and remembrance of God and his will, which in his word is reuealed vnto vs. The first grace is sauing knowledge and spirituall wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the which is notably preserued, and exceedingly increased by crosses and calamities: for this fire of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions doth giue great light to the vnderstanding; and this sharpe eye-salue, though it doth for the present dazle the sight, yet afterwards it doth singularly cleere the eyes of the minde, so as they are much fitter to see spirituall things, and to discerne the wayes of God. And whereas prosperity, vsually making men drunke with worldly pleasures, doth so take away the heart, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicate the braine, and infatuate the vnderstanding, that it is not capable of the knowledge of God and spirituall things: when by a fast of afflictions wee are freed from this surfet, and by long abstinence haue these intoxicating fumes of worldly vanities taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, then doe we come vnto our selues, and recouer our vnderstanding, wherby we are inabled to iudge and discerne of spirituall things, and to conceiue of God and his will, as they are reuealed vnto vs in his word. So the wise man sayth, that the <hi>rod and correction giue wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 29. 15</note> And the Prophet telleth the people, who were growne desperate in their wickednesse, that seeing they did not regard Gods word and terrible threatnings, to be reclaimed by them from their sinnes, and nothing but feare, proceeding from sense of Gods iudgements, would worke vpon their hard hearts; therfore the Lord would inflict vpon them plagues and calamities, that these punishments might cause them to feare him, and this feare might make them so attentiue to his word, that they might vnderstand it and profit by it; <hi>and there shall be only feare</hi> (sayth hee) <hi>to make you vnderstand the hearing;</hi> that is the word of the Lord, sounding in your<note place="margin">Esa. 28. 19.</note> eares by the ministery of his Prophets, which in your security caused by prosperity, you would not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:10735:241"/> but scorned and tormented. Thus the people of Israell being in great afflictions, are brought in by the Prophet saying one to another: <hi>Come and let vs returne</hi>

                  <hi>the rodde of correction shall driue it away from them.</hi> And as experience teacheth vs, that cockered chilren are sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome wise, because the Parents indulgence and fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse maketh the child wanton, and wantonnesse is the cause of much foolishnesse; and contrariwise, that those, who are kept vnder a seuere discipline, doe most excell in knowledge, discretion and vnderstanding, because they are made hereby more watchfull ouer their words and waies, powdring them with wisdome, before they dare offer thē to be tasted by their gouernours: So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, when our heauenly father suffereth vs to abound in earthly delights, and to haue the world at will, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wanton through prosperity, and foolish through our wantonnesse: but when hee nurtereth vs in the schoole of afflictions, we labour to informe our selues in those things which please ordisplease him, and so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we frame our words and actions. An example wherof we haue in <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who being in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity, was blinde in his vnderstanding, and ignorant of the true God, from whence proceeded his foolish boasting and vaine-glorious bragging: <hi>Is not this great Babell, which I haue built for the house of the kingdome, by the might of my power, and for the glory of my maiesty?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 4. 27. 31.</note> But when he was humbled by a grieuous affliction, then his vnderstanding was restored vnto him; and hee doth

                  <hi>for euer:</hi> whereby it appeareth, that as the sun-shine of prosperity doth so dazle our spiritull sight, and so dim the eyes of our vnderstanding, that wee are not capable of the knowledge of God and heauenly things, so the darknes of afflictions doth notably recouer and cleare them, so that they can discerne the will of God, when the light of the word appeareth to them. And this commeth to passe first, because in our afflictions we are made more diligent in hearkening vnto those admonitions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, which we haue contemned in the time of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity, and are more industrious and laborious in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning those spiritual lessons of wisdom, when as we feare the rod of correction, and do feele the smart of our neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and ignorance.

                  <hi>good for him to haue beene afflicted, that he might learne Gods statutes.</hi> So the Iewes when they were troubled in conscience, &amp; afflicted in mind, through the sense which they had of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

                  <note place="margin">Chap. 16. 29</note> Secondly, these afflictions doe notably increase spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall wisedome and sauing knowledge, as they doe sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son our natural wit, and that knowledge which we haue attained vnto by the light of Gods word, making them which are vnsauoury and fruit lesse in then selues, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come sauoury and profitable. For, by our afflictions wee haue experience, and by experience wisdome; in which respect it is truly sayd, that afflictions doe make
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:10735:242"/> fooles wise; for whereas almost none can make any vse of that knowledge which they haue by their owne wit and naturall vnderstanding (in regard whereof it is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sayd, that wit is nothing worth, vntill it bee dearely bought) no nor yet by the experience, which they haue by others euils: whē their knowledge is seasoned &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by their owne experience, then they make vse of that they know, and euery notion in their vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thus confirmed, becommeth a principle to inform their iudgements, and a rule to reforme and direct their liues. And thus in our afflictions we haue experience of Gods wrath and anger against sin, seeing he doth cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise and correct it euen in his owne children; and so ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing felt the smart of our former folly in committing it, we become wiser for the time to come, and will not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be allured to swallow this hooke againe, after wee haue been once pricked with it, though it bee couered with the inticing baites of worldly vanities, or to feede on the dainty meats of sinful pleasures, when we by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience find what a bitter and loathsom after-tast they haue left behind them.</p>
               <p>Thus also wee haue experience in our afflictions of Gods infinite wisedome, whereby hee bringeth good out of euill, light out of darknesse, blessings out of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and maketh the fruits of sinne the meanes of saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, causing vs to finde a ready way into the ioyes of heauen, by the gates of hell, and the first flashes of hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish fire: And also of his omnipotent power, whereby he mightily effecteth all this which he hath in this wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome purposed, supporting vs in our greatest weaknes, and defending vs, when we are most vnable to helpe our selues, against all the furious assaults of our malitious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. Thus we haue experience of his wise and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull prouidence, when as we perceiue that all our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, with whatsoeuer circumstances belong vnto them, are ruled by it; and though in themselues they
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:10735:243"/> are euill and hurtfull, yet that they are so wisely dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that in the end they turne to our good, and do much further the saluation of our soules; of his infinite mercy and loue wherby he moderateth and mitigateth all our afflictions, so as they may not exceed our strength, and sweetneth them by the inward comforts of his spirit, &amp; the taste &amp; feeling of his grace and fauour, that we haue more true ioy in them, then worldlings in the fruition of all their pleasures: And finally of his truth, both in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting those chastisements which he hath threatned, and in performing of all his promises, both in strengthening and supporting vs whilest we are vnder the burthen of the crosse, and in deliuering vs from all our afflictions, in such time as is most conuenient and seasonable, both for his owne glory, and the aduancing of our spirituall good.</p>
               <p>Yea, not onely doe wee by afflictions attaine to the knowledge of Gods excellencies and perfections, but also of the worlds mutability and vanity. For howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer looking vpon men in their flourishing prosperity we think their estate so excellent that it cannot be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and so permanent that it cannot be changed; when we see our health turned into sicknes, and strength into weaknes, our riches into pouerty, and our honors into disgrace and contempt, our mirth into mourning, and our liberty into imprisonment, then do wee plainly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne that worldly felicity is but a smoake or dreame which sodainly vanisheth and leaueth nothing behinde it; and therefore we will not, when we enioy it, put our confidence in it, nor set our hearts vpon it, and as we will not much reioyce when it befalleth vs, so wil we not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurably mourne when it departeth.<note place="margin">Sect. 4. That the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of spirituall wisdome much exceedeth our hurt by afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore, seeing these worldly afflictions doe so much increase sauing knowledge &amp; heauenly wisdome, this consideration should moue vs to beare them with great patience and comfort, in as much as our earthly
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:10735:243"/> losses, are far exceeded by our spirituall gaine; and our outward grieuances are abundantly recompenced with inward benefits. For this <hi>wisdome is better then pretious</hi>

               <p>The other grace seated in the intellectuall part of the soule, is the remembrance of God and his will, which is also much increased and renewed by afflictions. For whereas plenty and prosperity make vs to looke vnto, and rest in our owne prouision, in secundary causes and inferiour meanes, forgetting in the meane time God, who is the author of al our good, because we are so sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with outward helpes, that wee doe not sensibly feele any neede of his assistance: when wee are forsaken of these worldly succours, and are left of these false friends in our greatest need, then do we begin to remē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him, who neuer forsaketh those that trust in him, and is alwaies willing, able, and ready to comfort vs, when wee flee vnto him in our distresse. An example whereof
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:10735:244"/> wee haue in the prodigall childe, who whilest hee had goods in his owne hands, spent all his time in reuelling<note place="margin">Luk. 15.</note> and riot, in banqueting &amp; whoring, and neuer thought of his gratious father, from whom he had receiued these guifts, which hee thus abused, till (all being consumed) hee was brought into extreame pouerty and misery; and then he remembred him, and thinketh of returning. And as in our afflictions wee are put in remembrance of God himselfe by standing in neede of helpe and comfort from him; so also of his word and commaundements, and those profitable admonitions, instructions, and consolations, which wee haue formerly heard out of them. And whereas in the time of our prosperity, wee carelesly forget them, and negligently cast them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde our backs, when wee are pinched with miseries and crosses, wee doe not only diligently hearken vnto those profitable lessons which are presently deliuered vnto vs, but also for our comfort, recall that which wee haue formerly heard; and is now through sloth &amp; neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect carelesly cast (as it were) into some by-corner of the memory. And as the seede in time of drought, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, long after it is sowen, buried vnder the clods, and seemeth lost and perished because it appeareth not; so the seed of Gods word being sowen in the furrowes of our hearts, doth lie buried often times vnder the heauy clods of worldly incumbrances, appearing neither to our selues nor others: but when it is soaked and steeped in these waters of tribulation, then it sprouteth, sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vp, and bringeth forth abundant fruits to the ioy of others, and comfort of our selues. And as slothfull tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, whilest their play daies last, cast their bookes care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly vnder the cupbord, and for want of care and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation quickly forget that which they haue been long in learning; but when they are constrained to come to the schoole, and dofeele the smart of their former negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, then they labour to recall to minde their lost les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,

In which respect afflictions are of singular profit; in that by an vrgent necessity they make vs to esteem &amp; treasure vp in the closet of our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories these treasures of knowledge, which wee would otherwise vilifie and cast out of doores: for so are wee ruled by the senses, which only apprehend present ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, that wee value euery thing according to present and carnall vse, and doe not care for the glad tidings of the Gospell, and the sweete consolations of Gods spirit before wee bee brought into miserie and distresse. And as hee who is in perfect health contemneth the Phisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and is ready to cast his drugs and medicines out of dores; but being visited with some greeuous sicknesse, doth honour and reward him, and thinketh the best roome in his house not to good for his potions and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dialls; and as in the time of secure peace, wee let the sword rust in the scabberd, and our armour vpon the wall; but in time of warre doe highly value them, and doe rub, scoure, and gird them to vs: so whilest in the time of prosperity wee haue no sense and feeling of our spirituall diseases, wee carelesly cast at our heeles the phisicke of our soules, and neuer gratefully remember our spirituall Phisitions, because wee doe not finde any neede of them; wee let the sword of the spirit rust in the scabberd, and the booke of God to ly moulding vnder

That afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons strengthen our faith by making vs more carefull in the vse of the meanes; and by exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it with these trialls.</hi>
                  </note> both in our head and heart, in our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and also in our will and affections, for it is not only a perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion which is an act of the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding arising from knowledge, but also a willing assent and application of that we beleeue vnto our selues for our owne vse; vpon which followeth our voluntary cleauing vnto the Lord, and our reposing and sole resting vpon his power, prouidence and gracious promises in Iesus Christ. And this faith is exceedingly strengthned and increased through our troubles and afflictions; first because we are then most carefull in the vse of the means for the increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:10735:245"/> and confirming of it, as hauing in our sense and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling much more vse of it, then in the time of our prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. For whilst we liue in secure peace, and doe not find our selues molested with any enemy, we cast the shield of faith aside, and count it but a burthen, if we should beare it: but when sathan and the world daily cast against vs the fiery darts of trouble and affliction, which as soone as they hit vs doe in a sensible manner burne and torment vs, then doe we make pretious account of this impenetrable shield, and are neuer at rest, but whilst we find it fast buckled vnto vs. Secondly our faith is stērgth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and increased by afflictions, as they are vnto it a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall exercise, wherein all the vertue and powers ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are tried and imploied. For as when our bodies are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured to sloth and idlenesse, their strength doth languish and decay: but when they are in daily exercise, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease much in vigour and ability; so when our faith hath no spirituall exercise, it is in short time enfeebled and groweth faint and weake; but when we are in aduersity and affliction, vexed with sicknesse, pinched with pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, forsaken of friends, blemished and defamed for our loue to goodnesse, and subiect to innumerable dangers, then our faith hauing enemies to resist and aduersaries to striue and wrastle with, doth stir vp it owne vigour, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all it strength and powers together, and finding it selfe too weake to make resistance, doth earnestly seeke to haue it strength encreased and renued, and to this end it first wrestleth with God by praier, instantly imploring and beseeching him to perfect the good worke which he hath begun, and so to strengthen and confirme it, that it may not be destroied and troden vnder foot in this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall conflict; and also meditateth in Gods gracious promises, whereby he hath assured all those that beleeue in him, that he will neuer leaue and forsake them, but will heare them in the day of trouble, deliuer them out of all their dangers and giue a good issue to all their
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:10735:246"/> tentations. And thus our faith is exercised and by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise increased in our afflictions; the which is one of the most speciall ends, why the Lord doth bring vs into these troubles and calamities. For whilst we haue the world at will, and are on all fides hedged in with the blessings of prosperity, our faith may seeme both to our selues and others a meere speculatiue vertue, whereof there is little vse, and like an vntried arm or which doth not assure vs of defence in the day of danger; but when we are in the middest of afflictions, it is tried with the bullets of tentations, and the more it is tried the more it is approued, and the more it is approued, the more it is strengthned against the next incounter. And in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith exercised: for after that the Lord had made his gracious promise vnto him of multiplying his posterity, and that in his feed all the nations of the earth should be blessed, he long exercised his faith with that great affliction of his wiues barrennesse, which seemed directly to crosse Gods promises and ouerthrow all his hopes; and gaue him no child till he and his wife were growne so old, that in naturall reason the promise seemd impossible to be performed. With which exercise his faith was so strengthned and increased, that after he had his promised sonne, and was commaunded for his further triall to sacrifice him with his owne hands he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came also victor ouer this tentation, because by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer triall he had learned that God was able to raise him to life againe, seeing in respect of the deadnesse of <hi>Saraes</hi> wombe, he had before after a sort (as the Apostle saith) <hi>receiued him from the dead.</hi> Thus also after he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 9.</note> to giue vnto the posterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> he long exercised their faith, first by bringing them into a cruell bondage in the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and after their deliuerance by afflicting them with so many cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities in the wildernesse, that they seemed, not to haue escaped, but only to haue exchanged their miserie and
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:10735:246"/> tribulation. And so the Lord after he had promised <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> the crowne and kingdome, did euercise his faith with innumerable afflictions, and by this exercise did won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully confirme and increase it, as appeareth by the hystory of <hi>Samuell,</hi> &amp; that singular book of the Psalmes, the most part whereof was penned in the time of his trouble and persecution.</p>
               <p>Thirdly our faith receiueth much strength and power<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 2. That our faith is strengthned in afflictions through the experience which we then haue of the truth both of Gods threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and gracious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi>
                  </note> in our afflictions, because in them we haue experience of Gods truth, both in his threatnings, in that for our sinnes he hath inflicted those chastisements and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which in his word he hath denounced; and also in his promises; seeing he performeth all which he hath vndertaken, not only in assisting vs in our afflictions, but also in deliuering vs in due time; in both shewing his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wisedome, omnipotent power, and all-gouerning prouidence, wherby he hath disposed of all things to the best. For when by experience we find, that the Lord hath shewed vs great mercy in crossing of our most earnest desires, hath brought vnto vs much comfort out of our greatest calamities, turned our feares and dangers, into safe security and ioifull triumph, and hath made the Whale, which in swallowing seemed to deuoure vs, to be a meanes of our safety and deliuerance: then is our faith by this experience maruellously strengthned and increased, and we thereby are inabled to indure the next afflictions with much more patience and contentment. And as the Pilot hauing escaped out of many stormes, and the souldier out of many dangerous conflicts, are so hartned hereby that they are maruellous confident &amp; couragious when they are tossed with tempests, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted with their enemies; whilst vnexperienced passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and freshwater souldiers tremble and feare in the least danger: so those who haue been exercised in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and haue had manifold experience of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, power and loue, both in assisting them in their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:10735:247"/> and in deliuering them out of their greatest dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, haue their faith in God hereby so strengthned and increased, that they are much more patient in afflictiōs, and more couragious in perils, then those who were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer exercised with these trialls; because they know that God is immutable in his goodnesse, and is now as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and willing to helpe and deliuer them as he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. So <hi>Dauid</hi> concludeth that because he had found God mercifull and powerfull in deliuering him from the lion and the beare; therefore he would assuredly deliuer him in like manner from the vncircumcised Philistine,<note place="margin">2. Sa. 17. 36. 37</note> and make him to become as one of them. And <hi>Paul</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raised by God, when the sentence of death by the verdit of nature, had passed against him, by this experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence confirmeth his faith for the time to come in this<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1. 9. 10.</note> assurance, that the Lord would againe deliuer him, if so be he were ouertaken by the like danger.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, afflictions confirme and increase our faith as they are notable meanes of working or renuing our<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 3. That afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doe streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our faith by causing vs to renew our repentance: and assuring vs that our fins thus cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected shall not come into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</hi>
                  </note> repentance, for as sinne doth wound and weaken our faith, making vs to doubt of Gods fauour by reason of selfe guiltinesse; so repentance doth cure and strengthen it, because by it (through Gods mercy and free prom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ses made in Christ) sinne is done away, as though it had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer been committed, and so we are assured that we are reconciled vnto God and receiued againe into his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer fauour. And fiftly our faith is strengthned by our afflictions, as they giue assurance vnto those who are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised with them and profit by them, vnto amendment and newnesse of life, that their sinnes which are here in this world thus corrected, shall neuer appeare to their condemnation in the world to come. For as they who prosper and flourish in their wicked courses, haue iust cause to feare, that they are in <hi>Diues</hi> his estate, who had<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 25.</note> all his good in this life, and was reserued to torment in that life which is endlesse and euerlasting: so they who
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:10735:247"/> haue no sooner sinned but they are presently corrected for it, and by their chastisement reclaimed and amended may assure themselues, that as now they are like vnto <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zarus</hi> in his paines, so they shall hereafter be made like vnto him in his ioyes and comforts, and not suffer both<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 32.</note> now and then too, seeing (as the Apostle plainly telleth vs) we are purposely chastned with these afflictions, that we may escape the condemnation of the world.</p>
               <p>But most notably is our faith strengthned &amp; increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 4. That afflictions strengthen our faith as they are signes of our adoption.</hi> Rom 8. 29.</note> by our afflictions, as they are vnto those who profit by them in newnes of life, infallible signes and notes of their election, vocation and adoption. They are signes of our election, for as the Apostle teacheth vs, those whom God hath predestinate to be made like vnto his son in glory, he hath also predestinate to be made like vnto him in afflictions; and as by this holy decree his naturall son<note place="margin">Luk. 24. 26.</note> was first to suffer, and then to enter into his glory; so we, who are adopted in him, must follow him in the same way to our heauenly home, first suffering, and then raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 12.</note> with him as the Apostle speaketh, This also appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the Lords owne speech to the people of Israel, <hi>you only</hi> (saith he) <hi>haue I known (or chosen) of all the families of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Amos 3. 2.</note>
                  <hi>the earth, therfore I will visit you for all your iniquities.</hi> And to <hi>Ananias</hi> concerning <hi>Paul: Go thy way, for he is a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act 9. 15. 16.</note>
                  <hi>vessell vnto me, &amp;c. I will shew him how many things he must suffer for my names sake.</hi> The consideration whereof should much comfort vs in all our afflictions and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions, which though to those who are the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our will, they are tokens of perdition, yet vnto<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 28.</note> vs who patiently suffer them they are signes of our salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through the grace of God, as the Apostle telleth vs. In regard wherof the same holy Apostle doth not onely bear with patience &amp; comfort his troubles &amp; grieuous<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. 23. to 31. &amp; ca. 6. 4</note> afflictions, but being to maintain his credit against the false Apostles, he maketh choise of his sufferings to glory and reioyce in them, rather then of those excellēt graces
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:10735:248"/> of Gods holy spirit wherwith he was so richly adorned.</p>
               <p>Thus also our afflictions are notable signes of our effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 5. That afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons strengthen our faith as they are signes of our effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all calling.</hi> 2. Tim. 3. 12.</note> calling, whereby we are seuered from the world, and admitted into Gods church and family. For they are Gods liuery and cognisance which he giueth all to weare who will be his seruants; for, <hi>as many as will liue godly in Christ Iesus shal suffer persecution,</hi> and our Sauiour telleth vs, that if any man will come after him, and waite vpon him as his seruant and disciple, <hi>he must deny himselfe, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 9. 23.</note>
                  <hi>take vp his crosse daily and follow him.</hi> Neither may we liue like libertines when we are intertained into his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and runne on in wicked courses without correction: but we must make account that our wise Lord and master will keepe vs vnder a seuere discipline, chastising vs for our sins, that we may be reclaimed from them, and not suffering vs to goe on in euill waies without checke and controulement, to his dishonour and our destruction: and howsoeuer hee suffereth others that are without to prosper in their wickednesse, and without any punishment to adde sinne vnto sinne, yet he will be <hi>honoured of those</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 4. 17. Ier. 25. 29.</note>
                  <hi>who draw neere vnto him,</hi> and as the Prophet and Apostle speake, <hi>hee will cause iudgement to begin at his owne house,</hi> and <hi>first plague the citie where his name is called vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> As therefore when the Mason and Carpenter polish their stones, and square their timber with their tooles and axes; it is a signe that they haue chosen them for the vse of building, whereas that which is vntouched is left as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse, fit for nothing but to be cast into the high-way, and to be burned in the fire: So when the Lord doth polish, square and plaine vs with troubles and afflictions from the knots and knobs of sinne and corruption, it appeareth hereby, that he hath made choise of vs to be stones in the building of his spirituall Temple; whereas those which are let alone, and not hammered and squared by this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly workman, are reiected as refuse stuffe, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vnfit for this holy building. Againe the world
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:10735:248"/> onely loueth her owne, and therefore when our Sauiour Christ by the preaching of the Gospell hath chosen and<note place="margin">Ioh 15. 19.</note> c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lled vs out of the world, then presently it beginneth to maligne and hate vs, and to vse all meanes whereby it may bring vpon vs misery and affliction. In regard wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we may conclude, that when we are hated of the world we are beloued of God; when it basly esteemeth vs and cruelly vseth vs, as though we were the very out-casts and of scouring of all things, then may we be assured (if we make good vse of these afflictions, by contemning the world which contemneth vs, and drawing neerer vnto God by repentance and hearty praier) that the Lord highly valueth vs, and hath chosen and seuered vs like pure gold and good graine, out of this masse and heape of drosse and chaffe.</p>
               <p>Finally as our afflictions are notable signes of our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 6. That afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons strengthen our faith as they are signes of our adoption,</hi> Gal. 4. 1.</note> and admission into Gods family, so also of our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption whereby we become sonnes of God and heires of his promises. For (as the Apostle speaketh to anoth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er purpose) <hi>the heire as long as he is a child differeth herein nothing from a seruant, though he be Lord of all, but is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der tutours and gouernours vntill the time appointed of the father;</hi> and is subiect to the like chastizement and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: yea oftentimes our heauenly father (according to the custome of men) when his sonne and slaue doe both offend, correcteth his child, but letteth the other escape vnpunished, because he is purposed to thrust him out of doores, and to take no further care of him; whereas he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to make his sonne his heire, and therefore keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him vnder discipline, that he may be found worthy to receiue the inheritance. And this the Apostle plainly expresseth, saying, <hi>whom God loueth he chasteneth, and he</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 6. 7. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </note>
                  <hi>scourgeth euery sonne whom he receiueth: If then ye indure chastening, God offereth himselfe vnto you as vnto sonnes; for what son is it whom the father chasteneth not? If ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yee be without correction, whereof all are partakers,
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:10735:249"/> then are ye bastards and not sonnes.</hi> Thus also God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth <hi>Dauid,</hi> that he would choose <hi>Salomon</hi> for his son, and approue himselfe to be a father vnto him, by corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting him for his sins, and continuing his loue vnto him. <hi>I will be</hi> (saith he) <hi>his father and he shall be my sonne: and</hi>

                  <hi>if he sinne I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the plagues of the children of men, but my mercy shall not depart from him, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore we must not doubt of our adoption, and imagine that we are not the children of God, because we indure such grieuous and tedious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; for though <hi>Salomon</hi> was Gods chosen child, and was called <hi>Iedidiah,</hi> because he was beloued of him;<note place="margin">2. Sam. 12. 25.</note> yet he saith, that if he sinned he would correct him, but in the meane time, would not take his mercie from him. So though Israel were chosen for Gods first borne sonne, and were as much more precious in his eyes, as the purest gold then the basest drosse, or the wheat then chaffe; yet were this beloued people grieuously afflicted in a misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bondage and captiuity, whilest <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the Aegyptians their cruell enemies, insulted ouer them as their lords and masters, in all prosperity; and whilest the cursed Cananites liued in voluptuous pleasures, hauing al those delights and comforts, which the land of promise could yeeld vnto them. And thus also before the flood, the wicked Caynites, and after the flood, the filthy Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, had all the pleasure and glory of the world, whilest the posterity of Shem, and the worthy Patriarches, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their time like pilgrims and strangers, and were tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moyled with innumerable afflictions: yea the Lord not only spareth the bondman and slaue, when he scourgeth his beloued sonne; but oftentimes correcteth his child by the hand of his seruant; according to that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle. <hi>He that was borne of the flesh persecuted him that was</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 29.</note>
                  <hi>borne after the spirit:</hi> the which is so euident by the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable examples of all ages, that it were but lost labour to stand vpon it. The consideration whereof as it may
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:10735:249"/> keepe vs from enuying the impunity and felicity of worldly wicked men, and from grudging and repining against Gods prouidence, because they who sinne more suffer so little, and we who sinne lesse suffer so much; they who rebell against God and despite him with their abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, haue plenty of worldly blessings, and all things at their hearts desire, and we who serue and feare him suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer miseries and want necessaries; so may it much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme our patience and increase our comfort when we are vexed with afflictions, and feele the bitter smart of Gods chastizing hand: seeing it is a signe that they are reiected as slaues, and are therefore left to their owne liberty; and we adopted as sonnes who are kept vnder seuere disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline that we may be reclaimed from our sinnes, incited to the performance of all good duties, and so be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and fitted to receiue our patrimony. Neither haue they herein any more priuiledge then the Oxe who being appointed to the shambles, is freed from the yoake and suffered to runne at liberty and take his pleasure in faire greene pastures; or we more hurt then the Oxe inured to labour, who indureth the yoke, suffereth more paines and feedeth vpon bare fields, because his master louing him, is purposed to reserue him for his owne vse. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard whereof as wicked men haue no iust cause of glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reioycing in their worldly prosperity, whereby they are but fatted against the day of slaughter; so the faithful haue little cause of sorrow and impatiencie in their afflictions, seeing their present smart increaseth their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hopes, and these corrections which they suffer and profit by, are vnto them vndoubted signes of their adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that God is their louing father in that he taketh such care for their amendment? for as when a man, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king two children as they are committing the same fault, doth correct the one and let the other goe vntouched, we seeing it, are ready to conclude, that he is a father or gouernor to him that is chastened, and but a stranger to
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:10735:250"/> him that escapeth, seeing he taketh no care for his refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: so when we see and feele that God correcteth sharply those sins in vs which others commit and escape vnpunished, let vs not grieue so much in our smart and paine, as reioyce to haue this assurance of our adoption. And this an holy father illustrateth and inforceth by this similitude. A man (saith he) hath two sonnes; the one he chasteneth, the other he leaueth to his owne courses. This faulteth haynously and is not corrected by his father;<note place="margin">August. enar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. in Psa. 93.</note> the other can scarce looke awry but hee is rebuked or scourged. But why is he let alone, and this beaten? surely because he intendeth to make this his heire and to put the other from the patrimony, seeing he conceiueth no pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible hope of his amendment. Now he that is kept vnder this seuere discipline, out of his childish follie iudging all things according to present sense, thinketh his brother happy because he is not beaten, and lamenting his owne estate is ready to say: My brother hath done such and so great wils, and at his pleasure transgresseth the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of my father, and for all his faults hath not so much as a hard word giuen him; but I am beaten if I but step awry. Wherein hee bewraieth his folly and want of wisdome, seeing he onely looketh to that which he suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and not vnto the inheritance reserued for him &amp;c. And therefore (as he saith) in another place) patiently<note place="margin">Agust. in Psal. 88.

Let him in rage flie vpon thee, yet he is thy father: Let him whip, afflict and breake thee (as it were) in pieces; yet he is thy father. If therefore thou criest, crie as vnder the hand of a father

                  </note> much confirmed by afflictions, as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther respects, so especially as they are to those who profit by them, notable signes of their election, vocation, and adoption. The like also may bee said of other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are chiefely seated in the heart, as affiance, hope, loue, feare of God, humility, and the rest. For first our affiance and confidence in God is notably strengthned and increased by our afflictions, when as being forsaken of all humane helpe &amp; inferiour meanes, he by his owne wisedome and power saueth and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs. And this is one speciall end why the Lord in mercy and loue, bringeth vs into tribulation and dist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resse, that wee may not trust in secundary causes and worldly helpes, when wee haue experience of their weakenes and insufficiency, but may put our whole affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:10735:251"/> in him, hauing made triall of his all sufficiency, and omnipotent power, whereby hee helpeth and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth vs, when as they forsake and faile vs. For natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally wee put our affiance in outward and inferiour meanes, because they are subiect to our senses, and trust in any thing weere at hand, rather then in God, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is able to releeue and succour vs, because hee see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth fearre off to carnal reason, and is only beheld and apprehended by the eie and hand of faith; and as those who are ready to fal into some deepe pit, being astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with suddain feare, do not consider what is sufficient to stay them, but catch hold of that which is next vnto them, and so often times pull that vpon them which they hoped would haue held them vp: so wee no sooner fall into any daunger, but wee presently lay hold vpon worldly helpes, and trust to bee deliuered by earthly meanes, as by our owne wisedome, strength, and riches▪ or by the aide and support of our friends, and the arme of flesh; and therefore the Lord in mercy doth often times withdraw them from vs, because they are but weake reeds and broken staues, which would faile and deceiue vs, when wee most rested on them; to the end that being forsaken of these vaine succours and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, wee might with full affiance rely vpon him, who is alone able to helpe and saue vs. And thus when the people of Israell being ouertaken with daungers, did not put their trust in God for their deliuery, but did flee for helpe to the Assyrians &amp; Aegyptians; the Lord caused them not only to forsake them in their greatest need, but also to be vnto them the meanes of their great miserie and calamity, by inuading their country, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming and leading them captiue, and miserably vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and afflicting them, in the land of their captiuity. By which experience, comming to a sight of their vaine &amp; sinfull confidence, they presently leaue and sorsake it, and putting their whole affiance in God, cry out vnto

                  <hi>and thy name is great in power.</hi> And after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wee, herein no better then they, trust in worldly helpes, rather then in God, thinking that our wisedome and power shall deliuer vs from daungers, our friends from pouerty and want, and that our Phisitions shall preserue vs in health, or recouer vs out of sicknes; and therefore the Lord bringeth these things wherein wee trust vnto the touch-stone of triall, causing vs to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to perills, pouerty, and diseases, that wee may haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the weakenesse and vanity of these earthly succours; and then finding our wisedome is to bee so infatuated, that in steede of freeing, it doth the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle and insnare vs in the nett of daungers; that our friends doe not only forsake vs in our neede, but also further oppresse vs with fraud and violence; and that our phisitions doe rather increase our paines, then ease vs of them; wee leaue these vaine helps, and flee vnto the Lord, resting vpon his whole power and promises for comfort and deliuerance. And being releeued by him in our greatest distresse, by this experience our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and affiance in him is exceedingly strengthned and increased for the time to come; for as wee are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident in the assistance of such a friend, who hath often helped vs in our greatest daungers; as wee trust muc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Vnto which our spirituall hopes when God answereth according to his word and trueth, and hath often giuen vnto vs that helpe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance which wee expected from him▪ then doth this <hi>experience worke hope</hi> (as the Apostle speaketh) strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:10735:252"/> and assuring vs in our expectation, that the Lord will helpe and deliuer vs, as in former times.

And though helpe and deliuerance out of afflictions seeme as impossible to naturall reason▪ as for old <hi>Sara</hi> to haue a sonne, yet if by manifold experience wee haue found, that our hope in God did neuer faile vs, then will wee learne with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> as to beleeue aboue beleefe, so also to hope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue hope <hi>being fully assured that hee who hath promised,</hi>

                  <hi>is able to effect it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So our loue of God is exercised, confirmed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 3. That God by afflictions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth and confirmeth our loue towards him.</hi>
                  </note> by our crosses; for this loue towards God (as the spouse in the Canticles speaketh) is such a vehement flame, and (like wild-fire) so vnquenchable, <hi>that much waters of affliction cannot extinguish it, nor whole flouds drowne it.</hi> Yea rather these waters of tribulation, being<note place="margin">Cant. 8. 6, 7.</note> cast vpon it, doe (like the water in the forge) adde much heate to this holy affection, when withall, the Lord with the breath of his spirit doth blow vpon it. And this will manifestly appeare, whether wee respect the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our corrections, the world, and wicked men, or the chiefe and principall cause, which is our gracious God, and mercifull Father. For the more the world ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligneth and persecuteth vs, the more our affection is weaned from the world, and the lesse that wee loue the world▪ the more is our affection inflame<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> towards God. And therefore the Lord being iealouze of our loue, and desiring to haue our whole hearts without corriuall, or copartner; doth suffer the world to vse vs roughly and vnkindly, that our loue being withdrawen from it, may bee fixed wholy vpon him. And as the louing mother when shee seeth her childe fonde on her seruant, and to neglect her who so much affecteth him, doth cause the seruant when the sonne offendeth to correct him, and to
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:10735:253"/> vse him hardly, that being estranged in his affection from him, of whom hee receiueth such hard measure, his whole loue may bee set on her: so when wee dote vpon the world with excessiue fondnes, and neglect our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father who deserueth all our loue; he maketh it, as being his slaue, to correct all our faults, and to vse vs harshly &amp; vnkindely, not only to bring vs vnto amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but also to weane our hearts from this pernicious loue, to the end that hee may haue the whole interest in our affection. Yea our loue towards God is increased, not only in regard of these inferiour causes and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our afflictions; but also, if lifting the eies of our mindes higher, wee doe take knowledge of the chiefe &amp; supreame cause of our chastisements, and discerne that it is the hand of our heauenly Father, who vseth these roddes and scourges to correct vs for our sinnes. For as wee finde by worldly experience, that cockring in the parent, breedeth contempt in the childe; and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and loue doe neuer match togeather; whereas seuerer discipline worketh in his heart awfull reuerence, which is a true mixture of feare and loue, and maketh him to shew all affectionate duty to his parent, that hee may obtaine his fauour; and so by continuall inuring of him in these duties of loue, it is at last made hearty &amp; habituall, though happily feare and formallity did first begin it: so if our heauenly Father should coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker vs with pleasure and prosperity, his kindenes would cause contempt; and contempt would like a fretting canker eate out the heart of loue, and make vs neglect all filiall respect: but by keeping vs vnder strict gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by correcting vs when wee doe amisse, hee worketh in our hearts an awfull reuerence, whereby we are incited to the performance of all filial duties, and to shew all loue towards him, that so wee may gaine some assurance of his loue and fauour towards vs, of which we make highest accompt, when as it is endeared by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:10735:253"/> of obtaining it. Besides our loue towards God is much increased in our afflictions, when as in his shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest chastisements, we plainely discerne his fatherly loue and goodnesse towards vs, and that not only in regard of their end, which is the amendement of our liues, and saluation of our soules, but also in respect of his whole course and carriage in the inflicting of them. For loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king into our afflictions with a spirituall eie, wee shall plainely discerne Gods wise prouidence, both in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting and disposing of them. Wee shall perceiue how hee bridleth and curbeth in the rage of our enemies, so that though their mallice be neuer so great yet they are not suffered to goe beyond their tether. Wee shall see his fatherly loue and care whereby he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derateth and measureth our afflictions according to our ability to beare them, making our crosse lighter when it is ready to oppresse vs, or vs stronger to sust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aine the waight. Wee shall sensibly finde, how hee sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth vs with his might, when wee are ready to faint, and lifteth vs vp againe, when wee are foiled or fallen. Wee shall in our outward crosses feele the inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of his spirit, the which are so pleasant and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that they are sufficient to sweeten a world of mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and as the Apostle saith, <hi>the more our suffrings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound</hi>

Finally seeing our loue towards our benefactour is proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned according to our valuation of his gifts, and seeing wee are brought to esteeme of Gods benefits rather by wanting, then by enioying them; Heereby it cometh to passe, that wee loue the Lord much better when hee
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:10735:254"/> taketh his gifts from vs, then when we doe securely pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse them. For by the want of them finding their value, we then know and acknowledge how much wee are bound vnto God for suffering vs graciously so long to enioy them; we come also by this cōsideration to a sight of the excellency of those benefits, which still God is content to continue vnto vs; and so are more louing and thankfull for the remainder of Gods blessings, then when we had all without any partition, thinking our selues (with the afflicted Church) more behold<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For whereas in the time of prosperity we are so blinded with naturall pride and selfe loue, that we neuer come to a cleare knowledge of our selues, nor to a true valuation of our owne gifts and good parts; but are puffed vp with selfe-conceipt, hauing a great opinion of our owne excellency, strength and abilities; imagining<note place="margin">Psal. 30. 6.</note> that though God should leaue vs to our selues, we could stand in our owne might, resist any tentation, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter and ouercome any enemy; when God bringeth vs into trouble and affliction, and exerciseth vs with those vsuall trialls of sicknesse, pouerty, disgrace, or losse of our neerest and deerest friends; then are we by them brought to a sight of our own frailty and infirmity, and by this experience find, how vnable we are by our owne strength to indure the weakest triall, or to get the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand ouer the least tentation.

And as cockered children doe struggle and striue with their parents, when they goe about to chastise them for their faults and with great impatiency roare and crie out, when they feele the smart of the first stripes, but when they see them resolued to continue and redouble their blowes, till they haue broken them of their stubbornesse, they at last become as mild as lambes, and with al meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and humility submit themselues to their parents pleasure: so when our heauenly father first taketh vs in hand after we haue been long cockered in plenty and prosperity, and beginneth to correct vs for our sins;

                  </gap>therly corrections furthered and increased. For as afflictions doe notably helpe forward our effectuall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and first conuersion vnto God, so do they much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our repentance, and prouoke vs continually to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the act thereof after our many relapses and daily slippes into sinne. And when hauing resolued to walke in the way of holinesse and righteousnesse towards our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly home, we are in our passage allured to turne out of the right path into the by-waies of sin and wickednesse, by hauing the baites of worldly vanities set before vs, the Lord casteth into our waie these thornes and briars of affliction and tribulation, making thereby our wandring and digressing so distastfull and vnpleasant, that we are neuer at rest vntill we be returned by repentance into the right way againe: So one saith that God striketh into the heart of man terrour and feare, that he may weane and with-draw it from the loue of the world, and pricketh him with tribulations, that hee may not loue his way better then the end of his iorney, nor his pilgrimage better then his country. For his fatherly chastisements produce sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and compunction, bring into vs feare and contrition,
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:10735:257"/> draw out of vs infirmity and infection, and cause vnto vs strength and recouery of our health. But this will better appeare if we particularly shew how affliction furthereth vs in all the duties and actions, which are performed by vs in the practise of repentance; for first, when God cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth vs, we looke backe vnto our former courses, and consider and examine our selues what sinnes wee haue committed, which haue moued the Lord to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict vpon vs these iudgements and chastisements; and by this examination we come to a sight and sence of sinne, and to an humble acknowledgement, that we suffer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from God, but that which our sinne hath iustly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued: an example wherof we haue in <hi>Iacobs</hi> sonnes, who by their troubles and affliction were brought to a sight and feeling of that grieuous crime, of betraying and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their brother <hi>Ioseph. We haue verily sinned</hi> (say they)<note place="margin">Gen. 42. 21.</note>
                  <hi>against our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soule, when he besought vs, and we would not heare him: therfore is this trouble come vpon vs.</hi> And because pride, selfe-loue and liking of our most esteemed sinnes, doth commonly dazle our sight and make vs euen starke blinde in this search &amp; disquisition; therfore doth the Lord oftentimes obserue (as hath beene shewed) an analogy, proportion and similitude, betweene the quality of the sinne and the correction which he inflicteth for it, and so leadeth vs (as it were) by the hand, that we may come to finde and feele it by this his guidance and direction. An example wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we haue in <hi>Dauid,</hi> whose sinne of murther and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, was corrected with the rape of his daughter and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines, and the murther of his children and subiects by one another. Secondly, when by affliction we are wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of our security, brought to looke backe and to say, <hi>what haue I done;</hi> and when by searching and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our owne consciences we see and acknowledge, how haynously we haue offended God, and feele the burthen and smart of sin pinching and oppressing vs both at once,
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:10735:258"/> then are we hereby moued to bitter griefe and harty sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, because we haue offended our gracious father, and forced him by our wickednesse to proceed in these seuere courses for our correction and reformation. For when our hearts are so hard that sinne alone will not worke in them sorrow and remorse, afflictions and sense of smart being added to them as a double weight, doe bruse and presse out of them sighes and grones: and this rod of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection beating vpon these hard rockes, doth cause them to yeeld streames of teares, and (as it were) to wash and bath our sinfull soules in the waters of true repentance. For howsoeuer in Gods dearest children griefe for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions themselues which they suffer, hath commonly the first place, yet this sorrow for smart, doth alwaies end in sorrow for sinne and when correction with sence of paine hath made the heart soft and tender, and hath filled (as it were) the cesternes of the eyes with plenty of water; then grace commeth and altereth the vse, and whereas it was prouided by nature for the deploring of our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is now imploied and powred out by grace for the bewayling of our sinnes, which are the deseruing cause of all our smart and misery.</p>
               <p>Thus also doth the Lord by our afflictions worke<note place="margin">§▪ <hi>Sect. 2. That by affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions we are mooued to hate our sinnes, to confesse them vnto God, to flee and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake them, and to serue the Lord in the duties of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse.</hi>
                  </note> in vs a true hatred of sinne; and▪ hereas it is so sweet to corrupted nature, that we are ready (as lico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous children doe sugar) to keepe it vnder our tongue; yet when it is imbittered with this gall of afflictions, we spit it out like a loathsome medicine, and begin to abhor that before liked meate, when such vnpleasant sawce is mingled with it. By them likewise are we brought to an humble confession of sinne vnto God whom we haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and to an earnest desire of pardon and forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that so being freed of our sinnes, we may also be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of our smart. And thus <hi>Dauid,</hi> when <hi>the hand of God was heauy vpon him day and night, and his moisture therby turned into the drought of sommer;</hi> laied open his sinnes
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:10735:258"/> before the Lord by humble confession, and spread in his sight all his bonds of debt, that hauing his sinnes pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and bonds cancelled, hee might be deliuered from that affliction and correction which did accompany them. <hi>Then</hi> (saith he) <hi>I acknowledged my sinne vnto thee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 32. 4▪ 5.</note>
                  <hi>neither hid I mine iniquity; for I thought I will confesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst my selfe my wickednesse, and thou forgauest the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of my sinne.</hi> And furthermore hauing tasted and felt the bitternesse and smart of these loathsome sawces and sharpe whips, we flee sinne with all watchful care for the time to come, which (as wee haue found by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) hath made vs obnoxious to them, and heedfully auoide the committing of any wickednesse least we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by displeasing againe our heauenly father, do moue him to resume into his hands these rods of chastizement and to correct our new sinnes with new afflictions, which in al likelihood will be more sharpe and seuere, then those which we suffered in time past, because we haue no better profited by our former corrections. And this benefit of afflictions mouing vs to flee and forsake sinne, is implied in that excellent praier made by <hi>Salomon: when heauen</hi>

And most happy may we thinke our selues when the Lord vseth these afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as spurs and goades in our sides to pricke vs forward in the way of holinesse and righteousnesse, when in our selues we are drowsie, dull and dead, vnto all good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and as cords to draw vs on in holy and christian du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, when in our owne disposition we are backeward and sluggish.</p>

               <p>And thus it appeareth that by afflictions our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is daily renewed and increased: The like may be<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 3.

Concerning the former we are to know, that whereas we like pampered or resty horses, are ready either to goe out of the way of righteousnesse, or else to stand still, or goslowly forward; the Lord vseth afflictions as a staffe to beate vs into the way, and to make vs to returne into our right course, from which we haue digressed; and also as a spur or goade to pricke vs on when we make a stand, or but small hast in going on in this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall iourney. And whereas like children wee cast the commandements of our heauenly father behinde our backes, when wee are too much cockered: and grow carlesse and negligent in all good duties which we owe vnto him, being left to our own liberty; when he strickt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calleth vs to account, and finding vs idle and sloathful, doth sharply chastise vs for our neglect of that duty which he hath required; then doe we with all care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence informe our selues in his holy will, treasure vp his commandements in our hearts and memory, and with all readinesse put in practise, as occasion serueth, whatsoeuer duty is inioyned vnto vs. So that this sweet incense of our new obedience doth then send forth the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull odour, when as it is offered vnto God by the fire of affliction: And as the sweetest rose doth spring out from among the sharpest prickles, so the duties of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience

And thus the Lord dealt with the Israelits; for when they had neglected his seruice, and sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, yet he saith because they had humbled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues he would not destroy them, but would send them<note place="margin">2.

We are trees of righteousnesse which Gods right hand hath planted, let vs not therefore feare to be cut and pruned with troubles &amp; afflictions, seeing God<note place="margin">Esa 61. 3.</note> thus purgeth and pareth away our superfluous branches that we may bring forth more fruit, as our Sauiour tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth<note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 2.</note> vs. Yea rather we had great cause of feare, if we were exempted from these calamities, fos as that is a fruitlesse tree which is suffered to grow wild and vntou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and is neuer beaten with poles nor shaken with mens hands, nor hit nor hurt with any stones or cudgels; which is therefore daily in danger to be cut downe and cast into the fire, because it doth no good by standing and growing: so it is a signe that we are fruitlesse trees still growing in the wild wood of the world, which must one day be cast downe and cast into euerlasting fire; if our heauenly husbandman taketh no care to purge &amp; prune vs with crosses and afflictions, &amp; if no blowes or strokes of aduersity and tribulation doe light vpon vs, who haue far greater cause of sorrowing in our expectation of our future burning, then of reioycing in our present flourishing. We are▪ vines of Gods owne setting, whose glory and excellency consisteth not in the broadnesse and beauty of our leaues, nor in the handsomnesse and straightnesse of our body and branches; but only in our fruitfulnesse, whereby we bring forth great plenty of the ripe and sweet grapes of holinesse and righteousnes; and therefore when we haue the beauty and brauery of our outward estate taken from vs, and haue these leaues of earthly vanities blowne away with the winds of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie, and our superfluous stemmes of worldly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance pruned and plucked from vs in this winter of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, there is no cause of griefe and mourning, seeing our chiefest excellency is not hereby impaired, yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because it is much aduanced, in that we are made

                  </note> descend vnto some particulars, and insist in some speciall fruits of this new obedience. And to this end let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that by these our afflictions we are made much more deuout, diligent and zealous in performing of all holy and christian duties of Gods seruice, then when we flourish in prosperity; the which is so euident that it nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no other proofe or witnesse then common expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in others, and the testimony which euery mans conscience is ready to giue vnto this truth by that which he findeth in himselfe. For who seeth not that when we abound with earthly blessings we grow forgetful of God, &amp; negligent in his seruice, either not performing it at all, or but with great coldnesse and drowsinesse, in meere formality and hypocrisie, because we seeme then to stand in our owne strength, and to be so well stored with our owne prouision, that we neede not his helpe for our preseruation and defence? whereas when we are brought into the streights of afflictions, and are dispoiled of all our worldly succour, when we feele the smart of pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, sicknesse, imprisonment, infamy; and haue no meanes of our owne whereby we may be deliuered; when we are not only sensible of present paine, but apprehend future dangers, and vnto our priuate euills, expect, that God will for our sinnes adde those publicke miseries of plague, famine, war and desolation: then are we awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of our drowsie lethargie of security, shake off our sloth and negligence, and finding that all our helpe is in the Lord both for deliuerance from present smart, and preseruation from approaching calamities, we think how we may appease his anger, and make him propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that together with his wrath the iudgements which we feele or feare may be remooued from vs. And then
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:10735:262"/> with all diligence and deuotion we worship and serue the Lord not for forme and fashion, but with all inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind and feruency of zeale, that so our seruice may be pleasing and acceptable in his sight. The which great difference in mens cariage and behauiour will eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeare, if we will but compare flourishing courtiers with poore cotagers; the mariners which are in a dangerous storme, with those which are arriued in the safe hauen; those which are sicke, weake and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of death, with those who are lusty, healthy and in their full strength; prisons, with theaters; burialls with banquets, and those who are inuaded by their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and in danger of vtter desolation, with those who inuade them and haue got the victory. For as among the one sort a man shall seldome obserue any example of religion, piety and the true feare of God, but contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise contempt and neglect of all the duties of Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, blasphemous swearing, impious cursing, propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Gods sabbaths, wantonnesse, ribaldry and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chast dalliance, lying, dissembling, treachery and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting one another, gaming, reuelling, drinking, gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandising and such like fruits of darknesse: so among the other we shall finde, that the fire of affliction hath inflamed the heat of their deuotion, making them to breake of their sinnes by vnfained repentance, and to turne vnto the Lord with an earnest desire and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to performe all the duties of his worship and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, in that maner and measure which he requireth; then they humble themselues before God in fasting and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, acknowledging their impotency and insufficiency to defend or deliuer themselues, and vnworthinesse to receiue any helpe and comfort from God. And yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incouraged by his gracious promises, and the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of his loue and mercy; they flee vnto him as their only refuge, protectour and defender, and place all their hope and affiance in his alone helpe and allmighty assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:10735:263"/> Then they receiue his word with feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and withall reuerence and attention harken vnto it, that their sinnes which haue brought them into all their miseries, may be mortifyed and slaughtered by the sword of the spirit: that they may be informed in the knowledge of Gods will, and also by effectuall reasons and powerfull exhortations, may be perswaded and pricked forward to the performance and practise of that which they learne and know, to the end that by this meanes they may be deliuered from their present affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions vpon their reformation and amendment, and may not be indangered to suffer the like or greater miseries for the time to come, that they may haue their patience confirmed and encreased with such arguments and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as the word of God plentifully yeeldeth, which will much lessen their miseries and make the weight of all their afflictions much more light and casie to be borne. Finally being forsaken of worldly comforts, they doe with so much the more diligence harken vnto the word of God, that thereby they may replenish their soules with spirituall consolations arising from the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Gods loue, and fauor towards them in this their afflicted estate, and the assurance of future happinesse in the life to come. For as those who flourish in worldly prosperity, doe with <hi>Ahab</hi> refuse to heare the word of the Lord, because it prophecieth no good vnto them, but telleth them that they haue their <hi>portion in this life:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 16. 25.

                  </note> afflictions and miseries doe make vs most frequent and feruent, diligent and zealous in powring forth our praiers and supplications vnto God. For whereas in our prosperity we either vtterly neglect this duty, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it carelesly and slothfully, more for custome then conscience sake, and for forme and fashion, rather then out of any respect of duty which we owe vnto God, or of any need which we think we haue of his helpe: when we are brought into miseries and calamities, and haue a sense and feeling of our owne wants, and of the great need which we haue of Gods assistance, then doe we flee vnto him by earnest praier, crauing his aid and helpe for the supplying of our wants, ease of our griefes, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from dangers. And as the child, fearing nothing, is so fond of his play that he straieth and wandreth from his mother, not so much as thinking of her; but if he be scared or frighted with the sight or apprehension of som apparant or aproaching danger, doth presently run vnto her, cast himselfe into her armes and crie out to be saued and shielded by her: so we securely enioying the childish sports of worldly prosperity, do so fondly dote on them that we scarce thinke of our heauenly father, but when perils and dangers approach, and are ready to seise vpon vs, then doe we flee vnto him, and cast our selues into the armes of his prouidence, and protection, crying and calling vnto him by earnest praier, for helpe and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in this our extremity and distresse. The truth wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will more manifesty appeare, if we consider the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the faithfull in former times, who being in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction haue shewed themselues forward in performance
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:10735:264"/> of this duty; thus <hi>Hezechias</hi> being besieged by the hoast of <hi>Senacherib</hi> flieth vnto God as his only aide by effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all<note place="margin">Esa 37. 1. 2. 3.</note> praier, whereas being deliuered in the time of his prosperity, he was ready to glory in his owne prouision of riches, and to relie too much vpon his treasures.

               <p>Yea being in this difficulty and distresse, we are not<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 8. That in our afflictions we incite our selues to call vpon God with many reasons.</hi>

As first by the consideration of Gods expresse comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, vnto which he hath encouraged vs to performe obedience by his most gracious promises. So our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our willeth vs to <hi>aske and we shall receiue, seeke and we shall</hi>

<pb n="512" facs="tcp:10735:265"/> whereby we refuse, or slothfully neglect to beg at his hands, pardon and deliuerance. Secondly, by calling to mind, that he alone is of omnipotent power, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore able to shield vs from all dangers, and to deliuer vs out of all our afflictions; and infinite in his loue and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy towards vs, and therefore willing to extend his power for our preseruation and freedome from all our troubles Both which are strong motiues to make vs flee vnto the Lord by earnest praier: for as when the storme bloweth and the sea rageth, the poore passenger can see no place of safety till he be ariued in the quiet port, so when we are tossed and turmoiled in this sea of miseries, and can see in all the world no safety or security, then doe we by feruent praier flee vnto the Lord, as being the only hauen and harborough which can keep vs safe in these tempests of affliction. Thirdly, by considering that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the instruments of our troubles be, the Lord is the sole author and chiefe cause of them; And therefore as the offender sueth not to the executioner for pardon, because he knoweth that he hath no power to punish or spare him, sauing that which he hath receiued from the iudge, but beggeth and intreateth that he will forgiue and release him, who alone had authority to condemne and deliuer him vp, to suffer deserued punishment for his offences; so we will not so much sue vnto the inferior meanes of our afflictions, when we are in trouble and misery, because of themselues they can neither hurt nor helpe vs; but with <hi>Iob</hi> we will <hi>make supplication vnto our</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob 9. 15.</note>
                  <hi>Iudge,</hi> and by hearty prayer craue of him pardon and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance, who hath absolute power in his hand to grant or deny it. Finally by calling to mind that he is (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle stileth him) the God of consolation, who comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 5.</note> vs in all our troubles, causing our consolations to abound and exceed our sufferings, as himselfe prosesseth;<note place="margin">2.

                  <hi>I euen I am he that comforteth you.</hi> And therefore when being in afflictions all worldly comforts faile vs, it will
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:10735:265"/> be an effectuall reason, to moue vs by daily praier to flee vnto him who is the God of all consolations, that we may receiue from him some comfort and refreshing, in the time of our heauinesse.</p>
               <p>And thus by our afflictions and by these considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 9. That God by afflictions maketh vs more frequent and feruent in praier.</hi>
                  </note> arising from them, we are moued to performe this duty of prayer, and that not only after an ordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but with great earnestnesse, heate of zeale, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencie of spirit; for though we be slacke and loose in this holy exercise, whilst we are at ease and rest, and not so much as touched with any trouble, yet when the waight of affliction lieth heauy vpō vs, it presseth out of vs strong cries, and salt teares; bitter sighes and deepe grones; and as waters running at their full liberty in an open plaine haue little force and strength, but when they passe through a streight and narrow current, are of such might that nothing is able to withstand their violence, so when our praiers proceed from hearts inlarged with worldly liberty, and not straightned or bounded with any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they are very weake and wandring, and of no force to preuaile with God; but when they issue out of the straits and narrow passages of trouble and affliction, they offer an holy violence euen to God himselfe, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it were his hands when he is ready to strike, so as he is faine when we crie vnto him, to crie vnto vs againe,<note place="margin">Exod. 32. 10.</note> as he did vnto <hi>Moses, let me alone,</hi> that I may proceed in the execution of my iudgements. And this feruency and zeale was in the praiers of holy <hi>Iacob,</hi> when he was in danger of being destroied by his enraged brother; for as he outwardly with his body wrastled with God, not leauing his hold till he had the blessing; so much more powerfully did he contend and preuaile with him, when as inwardly he powred forth his soule in feruent praier, weeping and crying vnto God for helpe and deliuerance<note place="margin">Hos. 12. 3. 4.</note> as the Prophet sheweth. The like we see verified in his posterity Israel, who in their trouble sought the Lord,
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:10735:266"/>
                  <hi>and powred out a praier when his chastning was vpon them,</hi> and that not in a cold and formal fashion, but with great feruency and earnestnesse, crying like a woman in her<note place="margin">Esa 26. 17.</note> paines of child bearing, as <hi>Esay</hi> witnesseth. And this heat of zeale and feruency of spirit they shewed when being in danger to be destroied by the great army of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listims comming against them, they humbled them by fasting and praier before the Lord, weeping so abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, that by a strange, yet excellent metaphor, they<note place="margin">1. Sam. 7. 6.</note> are said to haue drawn out water from their eies, as with buckets out of a well, and not only to haue besprinkled the ground with distilling teares, but to haue powred them out in full streames. So the Church and people of God being grieuously afflicted in the time of their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity doe in a most patheticall manner shew this feruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of spirit and importunate earnestnesse in their praiers vnto God for helpe and deliuerance. For <hi>their heart cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Sion, let teares</hi>

Arise, cry out in the night, in the beginning of the watches powre out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift vp thy hands towards him for the life of thy yong children that faint for hunger in the corners of euery street.</hi> And this was vsuall with them, as we may see in the history of the Iudges and Kings (as also <hi>Nehemiah</hi> obserueth) namely, that when for<note place="margin">Nehem. 9. 27.</note> their sinnes they were deliuered into the hands of their enemies, then they would crie vnto the Lord in praier, till he heard them from heauen and sent them sauiours. Yea so feruent were they at such times in their supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that they could not content themselues with their owne importunity, but earnestly intreated Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to become suiters and soliciters for them. For in that wonderfull humiliation before spoken of, they say vnto <hi>Samuel, Cease not to cry vnto the Lord our God for vs</hi>

<pb n="515" facs="tcp:10735:266"/> being terrified with an extraordinary thunder and raine in the time of haruest, they earnestly desire him, to pray for them vnto the Lord his God that they might not die and perish. Thus also the <hi>Niniuites</hi> being in daunger of<note place="margin">Chap. 12. 19</note> destruction, are commanded by their King, to humble themselues by fasting and putting: on sackcloth, and <hi>to crie mightily vnto God.</hi> And the disciples who left Christ quietly asleepe, when they were secure, being in danger of drowning run vnto him with great earnestnesse, and cry aloud, <hi>master, master, saue vs we perish.</hi> Yea our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our<note place="margin">Math. 8. 24.</note> Christ himselfe, though he was continually conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in offering vp the sacrifice of praier vnto his father; yet was he most frequent and feruent in performing this duty in the time of his greatest afflictions; for being in<note place="margin">Math. 26 44.

                  <hi>strong crying and teares, vnto him that was able to saue him from death,</hi> as the Apostle witnesseth. By all which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that afflictions doe make vs more frequent, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and earnest, in this holy exercise of praier, whereof it is, that the Lord taking speciall delight in this zeale &amp; feruency, doth after a more especiall manner command vs to offer vp vnto him our praiers and petitions in the time of affliction, &amp; incourageth vs therunto by a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al promise of helpe &amp; deliuerance. <hi>Call vpon me</hi> (saith he) <hi>in the day of trouble, so will I deliuer thee and thou shalt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 50. 15.</note>
                  <hi>me.</hi> So by the Prophet <hi>Ioel,</hi> he commandeth them in their grieuous famine, <hi>to sanctifie a fast, to call a solemne assembly, to gather the Elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of their God, and to crie vnto the Lord.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioel. 1. 14.</note> Yea in truth this is one especiall end why the Lord brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the faithfull into troubles and afflictions, that whereas they in the time of their prosperity neglect this duty of his seruice, or performe it formally and coldly, they may be moued with the sense and smart of these
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:10735:267"/> euills to call vpon him with all zeale, earnestnesse and feruency of spirit, as appeareth by the scope and drift,<note place="margin">Luk 18. 1. 7.</note> at which our Sauiour aymed in the parable of the distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed widdow and vnrighteous iudge, who by her often crying and calling vpon him, was moued to do her iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice; and of the two friends the one whereof borroweth<note place="margin">Luk 11. 8.</note> of the other three loaues, through his importunity, though he had a deniall at the first motion. And thus our sauiour Christ gaue vnto the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> diuers repulses, not because he was vnwilling to grant her suit, but to make her more instant and earnest in praying for<note place="margin">Math. 15. 28.</note> helpe and deliuerance from her grieuous affliction.</p>
               <p>And thus haue I generally shewed, that troubles and calamities make vs more diligent and seruent in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 10. That by affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions we are made more sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of sinne and more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest in our petitions.</hi>
                  </note> this duty of holy praier, the which is a sacrifice most acceptable vnto God and most profitable for vs. Now further this wil also appeare, if we consider the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall parts of praier; for first howsoeuer in the time of our prosperity we disguise and so cunningly hide our sinnes, that euen our selues haue no sight or sense of them, yet when we are brought into misery and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we straitly examine our waies and workes, yea and narrowly search into the secret corners of our harts, that so we may find out those sinnes whereby we haue prouoked Gods displeasure; and hauing found them, we (as it were) hale them into Gods presence, and with all sincerity lay them open in his sight by humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, being incouraged by Gods gracious promises, that <hi>if we confesse and forsake our sinnes we shall find mercy;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 28. 13.</note> and that <hi>if we acknowledge our sins we shall find him faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Ioh 1. 19.</note>
                  <hi>and iust in forgiuing them and in cleansing vs from all iniquities</hi> &amp; not only so, but in deliuering vs from those euills of punishments which doe accompany them. An example whereof we haue in the people of Israel, who<note place="margin">Num. 21. 6. 7.</note> being stung with the fiery serpents confesse their sinnes and pray vnto the Lord. So being sore vexed and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:10735:267"/> by their enemies, they crie vnto the Lord saying, <hi>we haue finned against thee, because we haue forsaken our</hi>

                  <hi>owne God, and haue serued Baalim.</hi> And thus the prodigall sonne being pinched with hunger and grieuously affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted returneth vnto his father, and with an humbled soule and prostrate body, crieth out, <hi>Father I haue sinned</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 15. 21.</note>
                  <hi>against heauen and against thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy sonne.</hi> So <hi>Daniell</hi> in the time of the captiuity<note place="margin">Dan. 9.</note> humbleth himselfe before God, and confesseth his owne and the peoples sinnes. Yea <hi>Pharaoh</hi> himselfe though he had no grace or goodnesse in him, yet by the waight of affliction had the confession of his sinnes pressed from<note place="margin">Exo. 11. 16. 17.</note> him. Thus also by afflictions are we made diligent and earnest in making our petitions vnto God, and that both deprecations whereby we feruently desire to be freed and defended from the dangers which hang ouer our heads, and from the afflictions and miseries which doe presently vex vs (neither are we euer more zealous, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and importunate with God, then when we are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced herunto with smart and sense of paine;) and also our suits and requests, especially that God will giue vs grace so to profit by our afflictions; and in such sort direct and guide vs with his holy spirit for the time to come, that we may amend our sinfull liues, and so walke in the waies of his commandements, that we may not hereafter prouoke the Lord to anger by our sinnes, and moue him in his iust displeasure to inflict againe vpon vs the like or more heauy iudgements.</p>

                  </note> thanks vnto God, and to magnifie and praise his holy name; first because (as I haue shewed) we haue then the truest valuation and estimate of Gods rich mercies, when we are for a time depriued of them, the which is one end why the Lord taketh them from vs, that by wā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them we may learne their worth, and accordingly shew our selues thankfull vnto God, either because he

Secondly because Gods infinite wisedom, powerfull prouidence, iustice, mercy &amp; truth, do most clearely shine, like glorious stars, in the night of our afflictions; namely as he doth inflict them, &amp; also order &amp; dispose them, appointing their manner, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and all circumstances, and so moderating them, that not exceeding our strength, we plainly discerne mercy in his greatest iudgements. And also his loue &amp; compassion do plainly apear vnto vs, in that the doth not deale with vs according to our iniquities, nor punish vs according to the greatnes of our offēces, but cōtenteth himself to haue<note place="margin">Psal. 103. 8.</note> inflicted smal corrections for great falts, and light &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany afflictions for such hainous &amp; grieuous sins, as haue iustly deserued euerlasting condemnation. In confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration whereof we haue great cause to magnifie and praise the Lord, acknowledging with his afflicted Church, that <hi>it is his wonderfull mercy that we are not vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly consumed.</hi> So also his mercy, goodnesse and truth<note place="margin">Lumen. 3. 22.</note> doe clearely shine in our afflictions, as he doth bring light out of darknesse, and good out of euill, making these punishments of sinne to serue as effectuall meanes to further vs in attaining vnto both grace and glory: and finally his loue appeareth both by his supporting vs with strength to beare whatsoeuer he is pleased to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:10735:268"/> by refreshing vs with inward consolations, and by sauing and deliuering vs out of all our troubles, when in respect of outward meanes our estate seemeth despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. All which and much more being obserued by the faithfull, doe moue them to breake out in admiration of Gods wisedome, power, mercy and goodnesse into praises and thanksgiuing, as we may see in the example of the Israelites deliuered out of the Egyptian seruitude, in the song of <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak</hi> for their freedom from<note place="margin">Exod. 15. 1.

<pb n="525" facs="tcp:10735:271"/> by this new addition, become more numerous &amp; grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous in his sight. It is true indeed, that some kinde of afflictions, as namely, losses, want, and pouerty, doe thrust many into vniust actions, and doe moue them to vse fraud and deceit, theft and robbery, to patch and peece vp their broken estate, and to make a supplie of the things which they want, by these vnlawfull courses: but I doe not speake of those effects which afflictions in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, by these afflictions wee are made more mercifull, pitifull, and compassionate vnto others who indure the like crosses, and miseries; and our hearts which are hard in themselues, are softned and made more tender, and in fellow feeling of their griefes, more ready and willing to yeeld vnto them any comfort and refreshing. And thus those who haue been ficke, are apt to pitty those most, whom they see pained with the like diseases; those who haue been imprisoned, doe more readily compassionate, and accordingly helpe and releeue those who are restrained; they who haue been pinched with penury, and pined with hunger, doe aboue others pitty them, who being poore doe want foode to feede them, and clothes to couer them. And this
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:10735:272"/> was one end, why God layed vpon our sauiour Christ himselfe, so many crosses and afflictions, that <hi>hee might bee able sufficiently to haue compassion of them that are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,</hi>

                  <hi>because hee was compassed with infirmitie,</hi> as the Apostle speaketh. For as hee saith in an other place, <hi>in</hi>

                  <hi>that hee suffered, and was tempted, hee is able to succour them that are tempted.</hi> In which regard, wee may with more confidence &amp; assurance go vnto him for helpe and succour in al our miseries, because himself hath tasted of<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 15. 16.</note> them. So the Apostle saith, that <hi>we haue not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in al things tempted in like sort, yet without sin.</hi> And from hence hee raiseth this exhortation, that therefore <hi>we must go boldly vnto the throne of grace, that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue mercy and grace to help in time of neede.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Lord thought it fit that our sauiour Christ (which was so full of loue, mercy, and compassion, that in commiseration of our wretched estate, hee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to lay downe his precious life for our sakes, that hee might free vs from our woe and misery) should bee partaker of our infirmities and afflictions, that his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heart might be the more en-tendred, &amp; made more sensible of our sorrowes by his owne suffrings; how much more need haue wee to haue our hard hearts thus suppled and softned, who haue little compassion in vs but that which ariseth from our owne sense and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling?</p>

And as the wild colt which runneth at liberty in fruitfull pastures, is ready to breake all bounds, and to run ouer any that stands in his way; but being well bridled and broken, submitteth himselfe to be backed with his rider, and to beare his blowes without any resistance: so wee being fat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But when we daily contend with new calamities, continuall vse and exercise in these euils, so thickneth and hardneth the skin, that being vnsensible of smart, we doe not faint or yeeld in any aduersitie; or if we be ouerthrowne through the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of our afflictions, yet (as it were) vpon our knees wee will fight and striue against them. But this will better appeare if wee further consider more distinctly, that our afflictions confirme and increase in vs both our strength and power whereby we are inabled to beare the burthen of any calamitie without sincking vnder the waight, and also our courage, fortitude, and christian valour, whereby we are hartned to indure the brunt of any incounter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out shrinking or base yeelding in this spirituall warfare. Concerning the former point experience teacheth vs, that as other creatures, so also men, are made more weake and tender by soft and gentle vsage, and much disabled to beare the brunt of any outward violence or aduerse casual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, when (according to their kindes) they flourish in ease and prosperitie; and contrariwise that they are much strengthened to indure any hardnesse or aduersitie when they are vsed and inured vnto it by continuall custome. Thus wee see that oxen which are bred and brought vp in hard countries and common pastures, are stronger to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure labour then they which are fed and fatted in sweet
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:10735:276"/> and pleasant meddowes; and that by their labouring they are inabled to take much more fruitful paines, than others that are pampred with ease and plentie. Thus the trees which grow in the soft and sun-shine valley are neither strong, solid nor firmely rooted; but those which standing on the top of the mountaines are exposed to all kindes of winde and weather, to boistrous blasts and stormy tempests. So we find by experience that their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are most able and actiue, who are inured to paines and labour; and that part of the body to be most strong and fit for imployment, which is most vsed and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exercised; &amp; contrariwise, that those are most weake and wearish, faint and feeble who languish in idlenesse, and spend their time in ease and plentie; and that hand which is not accustomed to labour, to be soft &amp; tender, that it cannot indure the smallest paines; that hard and poore education maketh the best souldiers, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall custome causeth want and watching, paines and toilesome labour, scant dyet and hard lodging to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come familiar and easie to be indured: whereas plentie and prosperitie, soft cloathing and daintie fare, doth so weaken &amp; disable the bodie, that it can indure no hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but is more indangered with winde and weather, cold and hunger, than with the force and violence of the most warlike enemies: that Mariners who haue beene accustomed to stormes &amp; tempests, finde smal alteration in their bodies in the roughest Seas &amp; fowlest weather; whereas fresh-water souldiers, and tender passengers cannot brooke the smell of the ship, nor sight of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and are extreamely Sea-sick when they are but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle tossed with some ordinary windes. Finally, thus we see that by much cunning men become more nimble &amp; better breathed, whereas sloath and ease maketh them slowe and putsie; that the daily trauailer goeth lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger iournies with little wearinesse, whereas they that keepe home are soone tyred and surbaited with going a
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:10735:276"/> a few miles: and that the tender gentleman taketh cold being in a warme house and well cloathed, whereas the poore husband man dareth the cold windes and nipping frosts with his bare head and naked breast; and is strong to indure the whole day any toilesome labour, when as the other panteth and fainteth with wearinesse, if hee worke but one houre. And as it thus fareth with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die inured vnto paines and labour, so with the minde ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised with troubles, and accustomed to beare the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the crosse; neither is the one more strengthened with continuall vse and practise to indure any outward toyle; then the other inabled with patience and comfort to beare by the same meanes any crosses and calamities. And therefore how weake and waspish soeuer we be in bearing afflictions, after we haue long liued in ease and prosperitie, yet if after much trouble and many trialls we remaine weake and wayward, peeuish and impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, it is a dangerous signe that we haue little or no spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall vertue and abilitie in vs, according to the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans saying, <hi>If thou be faint in the day of aduersitie, thy</hi>

The souldier when he first entreth into the field, feareth when he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth but a false alarum, and is ready to ducke at euery shot; whereas after he hath passed desperate dangers, and hath beene long exercised in many conflicts and skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes, he becommeth so valorous and couragious, that he dareth to venter vpon the push of the pike, and to fight at the cannons mouth: now lesse fearing the cruell enemie, and killing bullet in a doubtfull and dangerous battaile, then, when he was first trained, the paper shot, and the seeming encounters of his friends and fellowes.

In which respect affliction is fitly called the perfectour of wit, and the refiner of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, because it forceth men by a kind of vrgent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity to looke about them, to search into the secrets of nature, to obserue the times and dipositions of all with whom they are to deale, and to trie a thousand conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, that they may finde out the best and fittest meanes for the remouing their crosses, and the supporting or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payring of their estates. Whereas if they should haue authority and friends, health and wealth at will, their wits would mould and rust for want of vse, seeing they neede not their helpe for the supplying of any wants: but are able to maintaine their estate by the present meanes which they haue about them. Neither doe our troubles and afflictions increase our wisdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge only, as they sharpen our inuention and quicken our wit, but also as they better our iudgement and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, by that experience which we gaine in the time of our tribulation, without which the other were to small vse; for wit is best when it is bought at the highest rates, and then onely is profitable when it is seasoned and (as it were) sealed vnto vs by deare experience; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it of any value whilest it swimmeth in the braine,
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:10735:279"/> and onely sitteth men for discourse; but when it is brought into vse and practise, and confirmed by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, then it attayneth to higher perfection, and of wit becommeth prudence and wisdome. As for example euery one can discourse of the euils which accompany vnthriftinesse; but he onely wisely vnderstandeth them, who hath felt and tasted of them. So many can talke of the dangers of suretiship, and yet vpon the next occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on run into it, thinking that though others haue beene vndone by the fayling of their friends, yet they shal not; but when this is confirmed vnto them by their owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and their goods are sold to pay other mens debts, and their bodies imprisoned because al they haue will not satisfie the creditor; then, when they are once quit of these troubles they will be wiser for euer after, and (like the bird) warily auoid this snare wherein they were formerly catched and insnared. So who knoweth not that innumerable mischiefes follow sudden rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and inconsiderate headinesse; and yet so are men transported with the heate and violence of their passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and affections, that they are ready to rush into sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den courses; till being beaten with their owne rod and feeling the smart of their vnaduisednesse they learne to vse deliberation in their actions, and (as we say) to look before they leape. And finally, who vnderstandeth not that surfetting and drunkennesse are the common causes of almost all diseases; and yet men are ready to follow their appetite rather then their reason; and through im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderation to abuse such meates and drinkes as please their pallet; but when they haue once learned it by their owne experience, hauing by their intemperance fallen<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 2.

<pb n="542" facs="tcp:10735:280"/> loue our persons, from parasites and flatterers who only loue our prosperity and flourishing estate. For when we abound with earthly blessings euery one is ready to fawne vpon vs, and to performe all good offices with an vsurious intent of deriuing hereby vnto themselues some greater benefit, as it were lending out good turnes that they may be returned vnto them with fruitfull en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease. Whereby it commeth to passe that wee cannot easily discerne who truely loue vs, and who only seeke their owne good, or ours for their owne sake; for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes the flatterer in shew and outward seruices ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth the faithfull friend, being more diligent to please and more ready at euery command: because the true friend performeth al duties for his sake whom he loueth, the flatterer for his owne sake that hee may aduance hereby his owne profit. And therefore seeing no man loueth another so much as himselfe, hereof it commeth to passe that as selfe-loue doth in heate, zeale and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uency much excell that loue which one friend vsually beareth vnto another; so the duties and seruices which arise and spring from it must needes according to the nature of the cause from which they grow, so much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede all those duties which proceede from friendly loue in outward diligence and seeming zeale, as selfe-loue excelleth the loue of a friend; and the desire of our owne good, the desire of aduancing the good of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

In this respect therfore our afflictions are profitable, as they pluck from vs false hearted parasites, which like the iuy cling about vs to sucke our sap, and to make themselues fat with our spoile; and to discouer vnto vs our true friends, who are hardly discerned from the other till this time of triall; for as the sonne of <hi>Syrach</hi> saith, <hi>a friend cannot be known</hi>

The daies brightnesse if it were continuall would become te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious; and the glorious light of the sunne would bring wearinesse, vnlesse it were made gratefull by the nights darknesse. In a word pleasure it selfe would not long please vs; if the glutting satiety of these sweet meats were not taken away by abstinence, or sauced (as it were) with the sowre sauce of intermingled miseries. And as common vse of worldly benefits doth dull the appetite, and maketh it to loth them; so it taketh away from them their excellency and worth in our opinion, and causeth the iudgement to vilifie and contemne them; whereas if we enioy them sparingly, and sometime be vtterly depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of them, then their worth is increased by their want, and they haue much better welcome at their comming againe, then they formerly had before they departed from vs. Thus that excellent iewell of health when it is continually enioyed is scarce thought on, but then it is sweet and most highly prised, when we haue long wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it through some tedious and grieuous sicknesse; So li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, though it be as precious as life, is but little regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of those who neuer felt the misery of restraint; but after long imprisonment it becommeth most gratefull and delightfull. And thus riches are most esteemed by them who haue formerly bin pinched with pouerty, and meat is most sauory, when it is sauced with hunger. Thus that victory is fullest of ioy which is hardly obtained af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long, doubtfull and dangerous fight; and the safe harbor is then descried with most comfort &amp; content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the passengers, after they haue escaped the perils
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:10735:282"/> of tempestuous stormes. Thus the delights of the spring are much more delightfull because they follow the nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping frosts and fowle weather of lowring winter; and in a word thus all pleasures which satiate and glut without mixture, doe become much more pleasing, when they succeed, and are often interchanged with crosses and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series. To which purpose one saith, that in all humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires there can scarce be any true ioy, vnlesse dolefull<note place="margin">Hieronym. epist. ad aegro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum amicum Tom. 4.</note> sorrow haue gone before, and the bitternesse of fore passed griefes doth the more commend the sweetnesse of ensuing gladnesse. So the husbandman is moued by his painfull seed time, to reioyce so much the more in his plentifull haruest, &amp;c.

                  </gap> the Lord doth but sauce his benefits, that we may enioy them with the more delight; and taketh away for a while his earthly blessings that after they are resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red they may bring with them the greater pleasure; let vs by this consideration be mooued to beare these cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses with patience and comfort; and as the vsurer, though he make an idoll of his gold, yet is content to want it for a time, because when the terme is expired, he expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth to haue it returned with some increase; so though our hearts too much adhere to earthly things, yet let vs be content to forbeare their company for a while, seeing vpon their returne the ioy and comfort which we take in them shall be much increased. Euen the veriest epicure (as we see) vseth sharpe and sowre sauces to make his pleasant meats to become more sauory, and is sometime content to prescribe vnto himselfe a voluntary fast to sharpen his stomacke, and set an edge on his appetite; that so afterwards he may feed vpon his dainty cates with more delight: and why then should we not bee willing to vse this temporary abstinence when God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribeth it, who being infinite in wisedome and loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, knowes best how to delight his children for their greatest benefit, and so to sauce those earthly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,

Now according to our order propounded we are to shew, that he also vseth them as meanes to conueigh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs such benefits as are euerlasting, and doe respect the life to come. And these are of two sorts; for by these cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements and fatherly corrections the Lord both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth vs from euerlasting condemnation, and also fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth and aduanceth our eternall glory and endlesse happinesse. Concerning the former we are to know, that wheras we in our owne nature and disposition are ready to take such waies, and to run such courses, as would, if we continued in them, bring vs in the end to endlesse woe and misery; the Lord in his infinite loue and mercy stoppeth and staieth vs from going on, by casting these blockes and bushes before vs, that by an holy violence
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:10735:283"/> and profitable necessitie we may be forced to turne back againe vnto him, and so be saued from this desperate danger. And as the careful husband-man setteth a hedge of sharpe thornes about his wels and deepe pits to keep his cattell from falling into them: so our gracious God, out of his speciall loue and care ouer vs, doth with these thornie hedges of trouble &amp; afflictiō, preserue vs (as we are ranging and rouing in the fields of this world) from falling into, and perishing in the pit of perdition. In our selues we are ready like silly sheep, to wander out of the right way which leadeth vnto happinesse, into the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paths of sinne and wickednesse; and so to become a pray vnto Sathan, who like a greedy wolfe rangeth about, that getting vs within his reach, he may seaze vpon and vtterly destroy vs: and therefore our carefull shepheard watcheth ouer vs with his prouidence, &amp; when he seeth vs thus to go astray, he vseth these afflictions, as it were the dog of the flocke, to fetch vs backe againe, and therewith as with the shepheards crooke and rod, hee pulleth vs vnto him, and driueth vs forward in the paths of holinesse and righteousnesse, which will safely bring vs into those heauenly folds of endlesse happinesse. If wee were left vnto our owne libertie, we would like the foolish bird flee from our Lord and master, and so become a pray to hellish fiends, who like rauenous kites, would seaze vpon vs; and therefore with these sharpe kniues of affliction he clippeth our wings to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vs from taking this pernitious flight, and restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth our licentious libertie, by putting vs into these ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of restraint, that so wee may be preserued safe from perishing in these dangers. Finally if we might haue our owne wils, we would, like wanton and vntamed hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, feede and take our pastime in the pleasant pastures of sinne, and would gladly keepe companie with wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked worldings ordained to destruction; but howsoeuer the Lord suffereth these fat buls of Basan to feede and
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:10735:284"/> Pamper themselues with these delights, to liue at ease, leape and friske about and take their pleasure, because he hath appointed them to be slaughtered in the sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of perdition; yet he restraineth vs from this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked fellowship, by putting vpon vs this yoke of chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and causeth vs to feede in bare fields, because he is purposed to vse our seruice, that we may inioy life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and not accompanie them in a common destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So that <hi>when wee are iudged</hi> (we may say with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle<note place="margin">1.

And therefore seeing the Lord vseth our afflictions as notable meanes, to preserue vs from falling into euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting condemnation, by seuering vs from wicked world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and keeping vs from accompanying them in the pleasant broade way which leadeth to destruction: as also by restraining vs from sinne when we are ready to fall into it, or pulling vs out of it by vnfained repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, when wee are already fallen (as I haue before more largely proued) great reason haue wee to beare these chastisements, not only with patience and meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but also with ioy and thankefulnesse; For (as one<note place="margin">Quis nescit quòd multō melius est ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere flammis febrium, quam flammis vitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum? Gregor.</note> saith) it is better to be burned with the flame of a feauer, then with the flame of vices; seeing by this the fier of Hell is kindled against vs, the torment whereof is into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable and euerlasting. Let vs not then thinke any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentanie afflictions heauie and hard to be borne, which helpe to free vs from those endlesse tortures, yea rather let vs praise and magnifie Gods mercy in them, in that being in comparison lesse then the by ting of a flye, they
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:10735:284"/> by awakening vs out of the sleepe of sinne and security, do preserue vs from being stung euerlastingly with that deadly stinging serpent of death and destruction; and being lesse to be esteemed then the prick of a pin, doe helpe to free vs from the tormenting racke of Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged wrath.</p>
               <p>But let vs consider further, that as the Lord in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 2.

Cor. 4. 10.</note> loue vseth afflictions as a notable meanes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue vs from condemnation: so also for the furthering of our saluation, and increasing of our happinesse. For as one saith, when as these euils of puishment torture vs, and in torturing doe not extort from vs the euill of sin; not only the soule is possessed by patience, but also when the body it selfe doth meekely indure affliction or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porarie destruction, it gaineth heereby secure and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouable safetie, ioined with euerlasting felicity; and so by sorrow and death, inuiolable health and happy immortality is procured. And this is the chiefe end at which (next vnto his owne glory) God aimeth in al our afflictions; for <hi>euery where wee beare about in our body the dying of our Lord Iesus, that the life of Iesus might also be made manifest in our bodies,</hi> as the Apostle speaketh; and as elsewhere he saith, therefore are we tried with tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, that our patience and faith being approued <hi>wee may be counted worthy of the kingdome of God;</hi> yet not<note place="margin">2.

So the Author of the booke of Wisdome saith, that the<note place="margin">2.

Thou therefore scourgest these, but withall thou instructest and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest them in safety; whereas thou sparest the wicked for a time, that thou maiest condemne them for euer. Thou instructest them to know thee, thou exercisest them to feare thee, that thou maist crowne them with glory. So another asketh the reason why God permitteth the faithfull to be temped? Is it not (saith he) that his vertue may heereby be tryed and exercised, and hee attaine vnto greater happinesse, for it is a more glorious victory not to consent being temped, then if hee could not at all bee subiect to temptation. And this consideration moued <hi>Moses</hi> not only to beare with patience affliction, when through vrgent necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty &amp; vnauoidable violence it was forced vpon him; but voluntary to choose tribulation with Gods children, rather then to be deuided from their society, because he knew that after his trials being approued, there was a crowne of happinesse reserued for him. For so it is said that <hi>he refused to be called the sonne of Pharaohs daughter</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 25. 26.</note>
                  <hi>and chose rather to suffer aduersity with the people of God, then to enioy the pleasures of sinne for a season; esteeming the rebuke of Christ greater riches then the treasures of Aegypt; because he had respect to the recompence of reward.</hi> Yea this was a notable incouragement to our sauiour Christ himselfe in bearing those great afflictions and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities which were laide vpon him, whose example the<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 1. 2.</note> Apostle propoundeth vnto vs for our imitation. <hi>Let vs run</hi> (saith he) <hi>with patience the race that is set before vs; looking vnto Iesus the author and finisher of our faith, who for the ioy that was set before him endured the crosse, and
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:10735:285"/> despised the shame, and is set at the right hand of the throne of God.</hi> And surely if we also would continually fix the eies of our mindes vpon the excellency and eternity of these heauenly ioyes, and consider with our selues that our short and light afflictions doe much further vs in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning vnto them, it would be a notable inducement to make vs beare them, not onely with patience and comfort, but euen to triumph ouer them with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing. Especially if we consider further, that it is not the bare bearing of these afflictions that doth intitle vs to this happinesse, but when with our patience we doe ouercome them; for as the Apostle saith, then are we to be accounted blessed not when we suffer, but when wee<note place="margin">Iam. 5, 10. 11.</note> patiently indure in these sufferings; then shall we be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partners with Gods saints in that glorious kingdome, when we are <hi>companions with them,</hi> not onely <hi>in tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> but also <hi>in patience,</hi> as the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> conioyneth<note place="margin">Apoc. 1. 9.

And then▪ and not before, shal we triumph in glory when we haue fought a good fight, and ouercome and put to flight these our spirituall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>But let vs somewhat more particularly consider, how<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 3. That afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons fit and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare vs for the kingdome of heauen.</hi>
                  </note> and in what respects these momentany afflictions doe further vs in attayning vnto euerlasting happinesse. And first we are to know, that our crosses and calamities doe helpe vs forward towards these heauenly ioyes, as they doe fit and prepare vs for the fruition of them. And this they doe in a double respect: first, as they make vs wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the world, when we finde such hard entertainment, and willing and desirous to arriue in our heauenly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where we expect better welcome. For as by the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the <hi>Israelits</hi> were inflamed in their desires to leaue that country, whereas they could haue
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:10735:286"/> beene contented to haue liued and died, if they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed in it ease, peace and plenty, and when their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions were increased, then and not before, set their hearts on the promised land, their face to seeke it, and their feete in the way which led vnto it: So when as we are so addicted to the world, that if without molestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we could inioy the vanities of it, we would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, yea earnestly desire to continue still in it; the Lord causeth this spirituall Pharaoh to vex and oppresse vs, with which seruitude being throughly wearied, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to forsake the place of our miserable bondage, that we may be freed from these afflictions; and earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to be in our heauenly country, where we expect to finde and enioy sweet rest, peace and fulnesse of all spirituall ioy, we thinke of setting our feete toward the holy land, and of walking in the way of righteousnesse and holinesse which leadeth vnto it. To this purpose<note place="margin">Gregor. epist. ex registr l. 2. indict. 11. c. 90</note> one saith, that if we rightly obserue the course of this life we shall finde nothing firme or constant, but as the traueller passeth sometimes by pleasant plaines, and sometimes by rough and vneuen waies; so we, whilest we remaine in this life▪ doe one while meete with pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, and another while with aduersity, which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably succeede one another, and change their course by turnes. And therefore seeing we are in all estates subiect to changes and alterations, our mindes should neither be exalted with prosperity, nor deiected with aduersity: but with all our hearts we are earnestly to desire to be in that place, where all things which are good are also permanent, and where there is no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change betweene prosperity and aduersity. To which end God so ordereth it by his diuine prouidence, that in this life either aduersity followeth prosperity, or pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity aduersity; that one while being humbled we may learne to mourne for our sinnes, and another while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exalted wee may retaine in our mindes the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:10735:286"/> of aduersity, as the author of humility. Againe afflictions doe fit and prepare vs for our heauenly happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as they serue for helpes and meanes, to clense and purifie vs from the filth of our corruptions and polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sin; For whereas no impure or base mettall, can euer come into this treasury of blessednesse; afflictions are that fiery furnace wherein we are purged and refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the drosse of our corruptions, according to that of the prouerbes; <hi>Take the drosse from the siluer, and</hi>

                  <hi>there shall come forth a vessell for the siner.</hi> Whereas onely the purest graine shall be stored vp in these grainers of happinesse, afflictions are the winde and fanne which purge and clense vs from the chaffe of sinne; whereas no vncleane thing can enter in thither, these troubles and cross<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s are the meanes to wash, and purge vs, as they bring vs vnto God by vnfained repentance. Finally, whereas faire and well-squared stones only shall be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in that heauenly building of the new Ierusalem, affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are those hammers and tooles whereby wee are smoothed from the bunches and knobs of worldly su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities, carnall cares, and earthly lone. And as the Lord in building his materiall Temple tooke order that the stones should be hewen, cut and polished, in the quarreyes, because hee would not haue so much as the noise of a hammer to be heard in his house; so in the building of his spirituall and triumphant church his wil is that the liuely stones appointed for this worke should be hewed and hammered, squared and prepared with crosses and troubles in the quarry of this world; because he is purposed that no touch of tribulation should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet and molest vs, when as wee are once placed in his heauenly Temple. For there <hi>all teares shall be wiped</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apoc. 21. 4.</note>
                  <hi>from our eies and there shall be no more death, neither sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, nor crying, nor paine,</hi> as the holy Ghost speaketh. In which respect one fitly compareth the Christians life<note place="margin">Gregor. moral. lib. 19. cap. 25.</note> to the Palme-tree which in it lower parts is enfolded

                  </gap>de of earthly misery and heauenly glory before spoken of; but also may haue it most strongly confirmed by an argument taken from the iustice, which must needs be in the administration of Gods righteous iudgements. For when we see that our selues and others, who truely and sincerely feare and serue the Lord, are subiect to innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable troubles, and (as the Prophet speaketh) are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted euery morning, one misery (like the waues of the sea) following in the neck of another, wheras contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the wicked contemners of God and goodnesse, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with all earthly blessings, and flourish in the pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of the world; from hence we may necessarily and infallibly conclude, that the righteous Iudge of heauen and earth, who will render vnto euery man according to his works, hath most certainly appointed a time for the punishing of their sin, and the rewarding according to his gracious and free promises, our vertues and holy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours; for the full freedome of his faithfull seruants out of all their miseries, and crowning of their faith, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and obedience, with glory and happinesse; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for the condemnation and destruction of wicked re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, who like malicious enemies haue all their life prouoked his wrath, and dishonored his name by their sinne and impiety. Neither will it stand with naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that God infinite in iustice and goodnesse, should create and ordaine his best creatures who are most care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of his glory vnto woe and misery in the world; and those who are outragiously wicked to flourish in pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity and and abound in all earthly blessings, if he had not appointed an after reckoning, and second iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the rewarding of the godly, who are here affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:10735:289"/> &amp; the punishment of the wicked, who are in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly priuiledges and prerogatiues so highly exalted and aduanced. And therefore seeing by our afflictions we haue so many waies assurance of euerlasting life and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, let vs indure them with patience, comfort and reioycing; for if there were no other fruit or benefit ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from them, this alone were sufficiēt to counteruaile and infinitly to ouerweigh all the griefes and miseries which are incident to the momentany and vncertaine life of man; seeing they being light shall haue an end before or with vs; whereas this superexcellent weight of glory, which they seale and confirme vnto vs, is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and euerlasting. If then worldly men are content to endure any labour, to hazard themselues to innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dangers, and to suffer many and grieuous miseries, that they may be assured of earthly things, their strongest assurances, being but vncertainties, and the best things assured, but trifling vanities; if the husbandmā toyle and labour in the seed time, in hope of a plentifull haruest; notwithstanding that his expectation is often frustrated, by many accidents, as foule and vnseasonable weather, too much drought, or too much raine, wormes, cankers, caterpillers, and such like; If the souldier suffer all those miseries which are incident to his profession, as watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cold, hunger, and be ready with patience and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to run into innumerable desperate dangers, which euery day bring him to the very confines of deaths king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and all to obtaine either the vaine breath of mens praises, or some small pay to defray his charges; and if the marchant compasse sea and land, and run vnknowne courses, with much paines and great perill, to get some wealth which he is vncertaine whether he shall obtaine or no; or hauing obtained it may after a tedious voiage perish in the long desired port, or be stolne or taken from him, by outward violence, when he commeth to land; with what patience and comfort should wee

               <p>Thirdly we are furthered by our afflictions in attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto heauenly happinesse, as they are vsed by God<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 6.

For whereas by our natural corruptiō we are ready to wander into the by paths of sinne, and to goe into the broad way which lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to destruction, being allured by the inticing baits of worldly vanities, the Lord (as hath been shewed) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth afflictions to serue as a thorny hedge and strong fence to keepe vs in our right course, and to restraine vs from digressing and going astray. And when being say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the sea of this miserable world, towards the hauen of euerlasting rest, we are ready to listen to the sweet Syren tunes of carnall pleasures, and leaping out of our ship of safety the true and inuisible Church, to perish by adhering to them in the gulfe of destruction; God in loue vnto vs vseth our afflictions, as wax, to stop our eares, that we may not hearken to these bewitching songs, but may without distraction hold on our course which will bring vs at the last to the po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Neither doe our crosses only keepe vs in the right way which bringeth vs to heauenly ioy and glory, but also they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten our speed in trauailing of it; and whereas in our own disposition we are sluggish and slothfull in our iourney and either ready to turne backe againe, to sit still, or at least to make slow hast in going forward, the Lord vseth afflictions as goads and spurs to quicken our dulnesse, and as rods to driue vs on, and to compell vs to make more hast, that we may more safely and seasonably come vnto the end of our iourney, and be better assured of the

                  <pb n="564" facs="tcp:10735:291"/> that the predictions of the Prophets might be fulfilled who <hi>declared first the sufferings which should come vnto him, and then the glory which should follow after,</hi> as the<note place="margin">1.

But there is no cause of griefe when we are inuaded with present calamities; if by faith we are assured of future comforts: neither is there any reason why we should vnmeasurably mourne for earthly afflictiōs, if they any whit further vs in attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto heauenly glory. And therfore let vs not in our afflictions fix our mindes on the euils which we suffer, but look higher to the happines which they cause vnto vs; &amp; being to passe (as it were by a narrow bridge) ouer this deepe floud &amp; gulph of worldly miseries, let vs not

So one saith,<note place="margin">Gregor.

And according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of our affliction shall be the measure of our glorious retribution. The reason whereof is cleare and euident; for the more the Lord increaseth our afflictions, the more he increaseth our strength to beare them; <hi>for he is faithfull and will not suffer vs to be tempted aboue our power</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 13.</note>

So
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:10735:293"/> that God measureth our greatnesse according to the measure of our crosses: and our glory according to our graces; whereof it followeth that our greater affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are signes of our greater grace; and the more we excell in Gods graces now, the more shall we excell in glory, in the day of retribution. Thus one saith, that our<note place="margin">Sed &amp; ijsdem flagellis crcuit virtus patien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia; at{que}, ex dolore verberis aucta est gloriae remunerationis Gregor. moral. lib. 3. cap. 2.</note> patience increaseth with our corrections, and that by the smart of our stripes, is augmented the glory of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.

And whereas our great commander bestoweth lesser rewards for lesser conflicts, when he commandeth his valiantest souldiers to attempt and atchieue the most valorous imploiments, it is his purpose for their greater worth to giue vnto them a greater reward. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noble champions think it to be a disgrace and great disparagement vnto them, when they are imploied in some ordinary seruice, or matched with a weake and contemptible aduersary; because his glory is greatest, which getteth the greatest victory, his deuotion &amp; loue towards God is most zealous and entire who for his sake is content to vndergoe the greatest difficulties and

O how great is our reward for our little labour! we see old souldiers which liue &amp; labour in the wars, euen from their youth vnto old age, and are still subiect to wounds and in danger of death, that they may enioy a few quiet dayes, when their life draweth towards an end, and when old age beginneth to burthen them, who were not burthened with the weight of warre; what hardnesse they are content to suffer, what iourneies and labours, what cold and heate, what watchings and wants, what wounds and dangers they endure with patience, not looking vnto the things they suffer, but vnto those few daies of peace and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which they hope to enioy in their olde age, vnto which they know not whether they shall euer attaine or no. And how much more then should wee endure the troubles and miseries of our momentany warfare, with patience and contentednesse, yea with thanksgiuing and reioicing; seeing we are certainly assured, that we shall haue euerlasting rest, after our few daies labours, and most excellent and neuer ending ioy and felicity, after our short sorrowes, and temporary miseries?</p>

                  </note> what fruits afflictions beare in wicked men, when as they follow their kinde, and haue not their nature by any superior power changed and altered. For if we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue them wee shall finde, that their miseries and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities doe not at all profit, but exceedingly hurt them; nor make them any whit the better, but rather cause them to become worse and worse: wee shall see that when they first fall into them they storme and rage with great impatiencie, tormenting themselues more with their owne vnruly passions, and with their strugling and striuing to shake off their yoke, then they are tormented with any sence or smart of the euils which they suffer; and that (looking only vnto secondarie causes) they are caried with mad fury, and desperate malice against the instruments and meanes of their miseries, and thinke of

Or if their punishments open their eies to behold their nakednesse, and call all their sinnes to their remembrance; and if with the noise or sense of these hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie iudgements, their sleeping consciences are awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, and begin to accuse and testifie against them, that they haue not only deserued the miseries which they suffer, but may iustly expect the full vials of Gods feirce wrath to be powred vpon them in this life, and euerlasting tortures and hellish torments in the life to come; then are they filled with horror and desperation, crying out with <hi>Caine</hi> that their smart exceedeth their<note place="margin">Gen. 4, 8</note> sin, and that their punishment is greater then they can beare, and then either with him they labour to bring a callum or thicke skinne ouer their galled consciences by giuing themselues ouer to all luxurious pleasures and carnall delights, and stop the cry of their inward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations,
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:10735:298"/> with the loud clamour of their sports and merriments, or if their calamities do so hedge them in, that they cannot come at these worldly pastimes, then hauing no helpe in themselues, nor hope in God, they flee from him as from an incensed enemy, and either<note place="margin">1.

So that the same fire of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which purifieth the faithfull, like gold, from the drosse of their corruptions; doth vtterly consume the wicked like straw or stubble; the same winde of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble which purgeth Gods good wheate, that it may be fit for his owne vse, doth blow away reprobate men from his presence vpon the face of the earth: The same an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile and hammer of tribulation, which break and bruise in peeces Gods elect vessels, that being moulten againe they may be framed a new for his vse, do make the ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantine hearts of wicked men to become the harder and much more obdurate; the same dosse of misery which is a good antidote and preseruatiue to Gods owne children, to keepe them from falling into the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall diseases of sinne, is vnto vngodly men deadly poison, bringing them to eternall death and vtter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.

As for example they vsually ascribe all their calamities (in stead of the supreme and highest cause) to destiny, chance and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, as though they might haue lighted vpon any other as well as vpon them, but that it was their hard hap to come in the way when as blind fortune, hauing these af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions in her hand, did by hap-hazard stumble vpon them.

Yea sometimes they
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:10735:299"/> ascribe all their miseries to Gods ministers and faithfull<note place="margin">Exod. 10. 28.</note> people who liue amongst them, affirming like wolues, that it is these lambes of Christ which trouble their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as we may see in the example of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> out of his presence, as the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses who brought all those plagues vpon <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in <hi>Achab</hi> who when the land was grieuously punished with a long famine for want of raine, accused not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and his owne sinnes, but the Prophet <hi>Elias,</hi> as the<note place="margin">1.

So when <hi>Saul</hi> profited not by so many admonitions and more gentle punishments, at last he was crushed and quelled vnder that fearefull iudgement of being his owne exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner, and became mercilesse to himselfe in his death who in his life had been cruell vnto others. Thus when <hi>Ieroboam</hi> amended not by the death of his sonne, nor drying vp of his hand; and when <hi>Achab</hi> repented not, neither for Gods threatnings, nor for the plagues of drought and famine, which were in the land; they were both rooted out with all their posterity, and became fearefull examples of Gods terrible vengeance. And thus when <hi>Senacherib</hi> repented not of his idolatry after the destruction of his army, nor acknowledged the true God in this miraculous iudgement, he was ouertaken with Gods wrath in the very act of his sinne, and slaine by his owne sonnes, euen whilst he was worshipping his<note place="margin">2.

Or if the Lord doe not lay vpon the contemners of his afflictions thefe outward and visible punishments he doth certainly inflict vpon them inwardly much more fearefull iudgements, giuing them ouer vnto their owne sensuall lusts, vile affections, and vnto a reprobate
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:10735:300"/> mind, to commit all manner of sinne with greedinesse, for the further sealing and increasing of their hellish condemnation. For as sure as God is iust, so assuredly will be seuerely punish this outragious wickednesse; if not in this world yet in the world to come. And their euerlasting torments shall be much more fearefully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, because vnto their other sinnes they haue added cursed security and hardnesse of heart, and haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned Gods righteous iudgements, growing worse<note place="margin">Quicquid hic passus fuerit home, si corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatur emenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio est, si non corrigatur du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex damnatio est. &amp;c.

Heere we must shed those teares which there must be dried vp: heere is the house of mourning, and there is the pallace of ioy and reioycing; here is the place of praier, which is most feruent when it floweth from an afflicted spirit; there is the place of praises which are most cheerefull when our happinesse is not distasted with any heauinesse.

Let vs not here expect faire weather and the sun-shine of our comfort; for a drie seed-time, will bring but a barren haruest; but let these teares of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sorrow, cause teares of spirituall ioy, because they are now seasonable, and doe but water our hopes, and make our haruest of happinesse much more plentifull.

Our pouerty must not much trouble vs: for who desireth in his pilgrimage and trauels to carry his wealth and riches about him? onely let it content vs, if wee haue sufficient to defray our charges, &amp; to supply necessaries in our iourney, and then expect to inioy our riches and chief treasures, when as we safely arriue in our heauenly country. Wee must not lay it much to heart, if we finde hard entertainment in the world, and be not esteemed and accounted of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our worth and desert; for we are not at home among our friends and kindred, where we might expect such kindnesse, because they know our state and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but in our pilgrimage, and at our Inne, among stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers who are vnacquainted with our persons and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and who examine not our vertues, but our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and outward pompe; not what we haue in our owne country, but what wee carry about vs, and measure all their respect and seruice vnto vs, by that profit and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit which they may receiue from vs. And who careth much for hard vsage in his Inne, where he is to remaine but one night?

Yea we must not be much vexed, if in this life we receiue wrongs and iniuries, and if we be robbed and spoiled through violence and vniust oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; for it is not strange with trauellers to fall into the hands of theeues and robbers, especially when they tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell in barbarous countries or in the dominions of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed enemies. But herein is both their and our comfort, that they can only spoile vs of some small trifles, which we carry about vs, whereby we only sustaine some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent want and misery in the short time of our trauels; but cannot take from vs our inheritance, our principall iewels and chiefe treasures, because those are safely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued for vs in our heauenly country; and we shall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly enioy them when wee haue finished our pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.

Yea euen Kings themselues who in peace aboūd with plenty and pleasure, in the time of war accustome themselues to hardnesse, because it best fitteth this sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; making them more valiant and hardy; and (which is the end of all) much more able to ouercome their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.

<pb n="595" facs="tcp:10735:306"/> the more it is abated, because what is annexed to the time past, is subscribed and taken away from the time to come. And therefore seeing there is no way to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality vnlesse here we be subiect tomortality; no way to liue and raigne with Christ, vnlesse in this world we<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 11. 12</note> suffer and be dead with him, let vs not dreame of a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing estate, pompe and earthly prosperity whilst we cōtinue here, but prepare our selues by the crosse to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto the crowne, by the vale of misery to ascend vnto the mountaine of glory; and by temporary death and destruction to passe vnto saluation and euerlasting happinesse.<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 5.

For if the Lord should continually cocker vs with worldly blessings, and let vs neuer feele the smart of his chastising hand, we would quickly forget and contemne him, neglect his commandements, securely goe on in sinne, and grow wanton in our wickednesse. The vtility also and profit of afflictions is (as hath been shewed) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 11.</note> great, seeing the Lord vseth them as the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meanes of strengthning and increasing in vs all his fanctifying and sauing graces, of conferring vnto vs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny temporary and worldly benefits; and of furthering and aduancing our glory and euerlasting happinesse in his heauenly kingdome.

<pb n="597" facs="tcp:10735:307"/> giueth his holy Angells charge ouer vs; to assist and compasse vs about, to preserue vs in all dangers, and to keepe vs in all our waies, that no other crosses befall vs then those which he hath appointed, nor yet in any greater measure, then that which in his wise prouidence he hath alotted vnto vs. For as the Angells ministred vnto our head Iesus Christ at all times, but especially in his greatest trialls and afflictions, as namely after that conflict of tentation with sathan our spirituall enemy,<note place="margin">Math. 4. 11. Luk. 22. 43.</note> and in his bitter agony, when <hi>as an Angell appeared from heauen to comfort him;</hi> So doe they by the appointment of our common Lord and master attend vpon vs who are his members, to preserue, defend, strengthen and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vs, that we may not faint and faile through our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall weaknes vnder the burthen of the crosse.

Thus the Angells atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon righteous <hi>Lot</hi> to deliuer him, and his out of<note place="margin">Gen. 19. 15.</note> the common destruction of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi> And an whole host of them encamped about <hi>Iacob</hi> when he<note place="margin">Chap. 32. 12.</note> feared his brothers armed rage; which at all times were ready (as he saith elsewhere) to deliuer him from all euill.<note place="margin">Chap. 48, 16.</note> Thus the Angell of God standeth between <hi>Israell</hi> and the hoast of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> persuing them, and preserueth<note place="margin">Exod. 14. 19.</note> them from being ouertaken by that imminent danger. And afterwards the Lord sendeth him before them to<note place="margin">Cha. 23. 20. 23 &amp; 33. 2..</note> keepe them in their way, and to bring them to the place which he had prepared: casting out al their enemies from before them which opposed against them. Thus an

And thus by<note place="margin">Dan 3. 25. &amp; 6. 22.

And howsoeuer the faithfull haue not in these daies such visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble apparitions of these heauenly spirits, nor such mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous deliuerances from dangers by their ministery; yet Gods loue and care ouer his Church being now as great as in former times; their diligence and watchfulnesse is no lesse to safegard and preserue from all perills, and to comfort and vphold in all afflictions those who are so deere to their Lord and master. And therefore if in all griefs and miseries it be a great comfort vnto vs to haue the company of some able and louing friends, which haue both some power and will to succour and relieue vs; how sweet and comfortable is this happy society of the holy Angells to those who being afflicted doe by faith apprehend their continuall presence, feeing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all comparison they are more powerfull and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, then our most potent friends, to comfort and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue vs in all our extremities.</p>

And as by vertue of this spirituall vnion with Christ, hee as our head doth partake with vain all our afflictions, so also all his saints

For to beginne with our great grand-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Adam,</hi> what miseries did he indure in his whole life, partly through the remembrance of his lost happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and partly through the pressure and vexation of present afflictions. For he, who formerly passed his time in pleasure and delight, and abounded so in Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings that he wanted nothing which his heart could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, must now labour in a new plantation for the furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:10735:310"/> whereof all things were to be inuented, and all necessaries to be prouided; now the earth which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly brought foorth all good fruits of it owne accord, being for his sinne subiect to the curse, bringeth forth nothing but briars and thornes, vnlesse it were tilled and manured with his toilesome labour; nowe he who formerly liued at ease, if he will haue his penury relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and obtaine necessaries for the sustaining of his life, must buy them with his sweat, spend part of his bodily substance, that he may nourish the rest, and waste his strength that he may preserue it. Now he who needed nothing, needeth all things, and hath no body to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him in his miseries, but she that caused them; none to helpe him in his wants but she who helped him to fall into them. He is indeed Emperor of the world, but hee hath no subiects to obey him; he is Lord of all, but he hath no seruants, no not for the basest offices. If he will cat the fruits of the earth, he must be his owne husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, his owne purueier. If he will haue clothes, he must be his owne tailor, and make them before he can weare them; if he will haue a lodging, to keepe him from the bruit beasts and the violence of the weather, there is no man to build it vnlesse he will be his owne carpenter and tent-maker, and in a word if he wil haue the pleasure of any earthly necessary, he must first endure the paines of getting and procuring it. Yea afterwards when he expected the comfort of society, and hoped to haue all his other miseries sweetned with the pleasure of his posterity, his hony is turned into gall, and there, as hee thought to haue found his chiefe contentment, he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his greatest crosses and calamities. For his dearest sonne <hi>Abel</hi> is cruelly murthered, and his other sonne <hi>Cain</hi> the first borne like a butcher or hangman imbru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his hands in his innocent blood. And so by the death of the one he is depriued of his comfort, and by the life of the other he endured a greater crosse: For he seeth
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:10735:311"/> him a vagabond, a reprobate, an enemy to himselfe, and the whole Church of God, and whilst he liued, dead in his sinne, obnoxious to Gods wrath, and as it were all ready adiudged to eternall condemnation. Now what a griefe was this to consider that his first fruits should of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himselfe to the diuell, that the heire of the world, should be the sonne of perdition, and the first that should hansell the fire of hell. But aboue al these worldly crosses he was pressed with the burthen of his owne sinne, which was the cause that brought all the rest vpon him, and the very sting that made all his paines truely pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and all his other miseries out of measure miserable. For he who was holy and righteous according to Gods image, now looking into the glasse of the law of nature, seeth himselfe made by himselfe most vgly and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; he seeth himselfe spoiled of the inestimable treasurs of Gods gifts and graces, and that himselfe was the theefe who had thus robbed him. He seeth nothing in him but the guiltinesse and filthinesse of sinne, ignorance in the place of knowledge, peruersenesse in stead of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, &amp; hatred of God in stead of loue. And one while he is filled with griefe whilst he considereth his losse, and another while with anger against himselfe as being the cause of all his misery. Wheresoeuer he looketh he findeth cause of lamentation; but yet when he is about to complaine on those who haue brought him into these miseries, his owne conscience apprehendeth himselfe as the malefactor, and he hath nothing to crie out on but his owne sinne. The like afflictions were that part of his posterity, which fered God, subiect vnto; for in that short story of righteous <hi>Abell,</hi> who was his true heire in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and godlinesse, there is only mention of his birth, sacrifice and slaughter, his seruing of God giuing the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion vnto his wicked brother to resolue vpon and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute that bloody designe.

What mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series and afflictions did they indure in the wildernesse fourety yeares together, as hunger, thirst, stinging and burning Serpents, and grieuous plagues, till all of them that came out of the land of <hi>Aegypt</hi> sauing <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leb</hi> and <hi>Iosuah</hi> were vtterly destroied?

The which their lamentable condition, we may see notably descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the booke of the Iudges, and Kings, in the 44. 79. and 139. Psalmes, in the Lamentations of <hi>Ieremie</hi> and many other places of the old Testament, vnto which for breuity sake I referre the reader. And the like, yea much more miserable and afflicted was the condition of the Church after the ascension of Iesus Christ, not onely by reason of those persecutions raised against it by the malicious Iewes, but also those much more cruell and bloody persecutions vnder the heathenish Emperors, wherein many thousands of the godly chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians were murthered and massacred, and that not by ordinary deathes, but by the most exquisite tortures and torments which witte assisted with malice could inuent.</p>

For as he neuer (that we know of) laughed in the world; so neuer did the world so much as smile vpon him; vnles it were with some false fauour to make ensuing disgraces and iniuries more grieuous and intollerable: yea contrariwise from the day of his birth to the day of his death, it pursued him with deadly malice, and heaped vpon him miseries and indignities. For though this rod and graffe springing from the stocke of <hi>Ishai,</hi> were <hi>glorious in his rest,</hi> as the<note place="margin">Esa. 11. 1. 10.

So the Apostle saith, that though he were the <hi>prince of our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb 2. 10. 5. 8.</note> yet God thought it good <hi>to consecrate him</hi> to this office <hi>by afflictions;</hi> and that though he <hi>were the sonne of God, yet learned he obedience by the things which hee suffered.</hi> And himselfe affirmeth, that it behoued him to haue suffered all those miseries of his life, and<note place="margin">Luk. 24. 26.</note> afterwards a cursed death, before he could enter into his glory. Now what and how great these miseries and afflictions were, it will easily appeare, if we take a view of the whole course of his life. For in his birth he had a common Inne for his kingly pallace, a stable for his chamber, a manger for his cradle, and the horses and bruit beasts for his chamber-fellowes. In his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy before he could goe he is constrained to flee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that his life might be preserued from cruell <hi>Herod</hi> who thirsted after his blood.

He is reprochfully called a wine-bib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, a glutton, an imposter, a deceiuer, a Samaritan, a sinner, and being the onely true and naturall sonne of God, he is said to be possessed with a deuill. He is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied of his owne Apostle, and apprehended with swords and staues, as if hee were an hainous malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor. He is bound who came to set vs at liberty, and to redeeme vs out of the cruell bondage of sinne and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than; and arraigned before a mortal, yea wicked man, being the Lord chiefe iustice of Heauen and Earth. He who is truth it selfe is falsly accused, comming to be our aduocate to pleade our cause and excuse vs to Gods iustice; and is vniustly condemned being inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and full of all vertue and goodnesse. Hee is moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and scorned, rated and reuiled, blind-foulded and buffetted; he is shamefully spit vpon, who with his spittle had healed and recouered the eies of the blind;
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:10735:322"/> and a bloody murtherer preferred before the holy and righteous. He is cruelly whipped, as though he were some rogue or runagate, and his blessed head is crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with sharpe pricking thornes, vnto whom of right belonged the crowne of glory. He hath a purple robe in derision put vpon him, and a reed in his hand instead of a scepter, and so he is scornefully saluted as a King in a May-game, who is the soueraigne Monarch of heauen and earth: The Lord of life is adiudged to death, yea the shameful and cursed death of the crosse, and he who is most innocent &amp; righteous is crucified betweene two theeues as though he were the greatest malefactour. The which kinde of death as it is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding painefull to all that suffer it, because the hands and the feete being aboue all other parts most sensible of torment, by reason that they abound with nerues and sinnews the instruments of sense and feeling, were pierced and nailed to the Crosse; and because the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures though sharpe and bitter, are yet also long and lingering; so especially (as some probably iudge) to our Sauiour; for whereas all the powers and faculties of our bodies and soules are by reason of sinne, and the corruption of our nature dulled and deadded, and our senses among the rest; the body of our Sauiour Christ as it was most pure and free from sinne, so was it most quicke and perfect in all these faculties, and consequently most sensible of smarte and paine. And thus also insteade of drinke to quench his thirste, they giue him Vineger mingled with Galle; and in stead of sweete comforts in the terrours of death, they wag their heads, flout and deride him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>Thou that destroiest the Temple, and buildest it in</hi>

He tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in God, let him deliuer him now, if he will haue him, for he said I am the sonne of God.</hi> But among all the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he suffered, not any one nor all together are to be compared with those tortures of his soule, when as he bore the vnsupportable waight of Gods anger due to our sinnes, which brought him into a grieuous agonie, and pressed out of him in the garden,<note place="margin">Math 27. 46.</note> those clots of blood in stead of sweat, and vpon the crosse that ruefull crie; <hi>my God, my God why hast thou forsaken me.</hi> By all which it manifestly appeareth, that there is an incomparable difference betweene Christs and our greatest sufferings, and that our afflictions being compared vnto his, are but a drop to the ocean, a flea-bite to the sting of scorpions, and a little fillip to the torturing racke. It is true indeed, that we and he drinke of the like cup, and the like ingredients, but like in quality, not in quantity; for his cup was<note place="margin">Ezech. 23 32.</note> large and deepe, like that cup of which <hi>Ezechiel</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth; ours small and shallow. His cup was bitter through the terrours of Gods wrath which he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, ours is sweetned through the mixture of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall comforts.

               <p>And these with many other miseries and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Christ our head suffered in the world, being most innocent, iust and holy; for as the Prophet speaketh, <hi>he made his graue with the wicked, though he had done no

And why should it be thought hard, that man should be afflicted by God for so many euils, seeing God suffered so many euils at the hands of men, onely for doing good? or who in his right wits can vngratefully complaine of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, if he escaped not the whip, who neuer was tainted with the least corruption? And as another<note place="margin">August. in Psal. 40. enarrat.</note> saith, if Christ were content to be launched and seared who had in him no putrefaction, and if he who is our medicine, refused not the medicinall fire and burning iron, much more ought we to endure patiently the hand of our heauenly Chirurgion lanching, searing &amp; searching our festred sores of sinne with afflictions and tribulations, that he may heale and cure vs. And therefore let vs wholly commit our selues into the hands of our physition, for he cannot erre in misapply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his medicines to the sound flesh, in stead of rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and putrified, seeing he who made nature must needs know the faults and defects of nature, and what imperfections are come vnto it through our concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence and corruption. He knoweth that he gaue a commandement to man in his perfect health, that he should not run a course which would bring him to sicknesse, saying vnto him in Paradise; Eate of this, and this forbeare: but whole man hearkned not to the prescript of his physition, that he might not fall; and therefore now at least let him hearken vnto him, that

               <p>But let vs further consider, that Christ in himselfe iust<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 3. That Christ being righteous in himselfe, suffered all these afflictions for vs who are sinners.</hi>
                  </note> and innocent, suffered all these miseries for vs, who were dead in our sinnes, the children of wrath, stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, yea enemies vnto God and his grace, that by these our sufferings he might satisfie Gods iustice in bearing that punishment which he had deserued, iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie vs by his righteousnesse and obedience, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile vs vnto his father, and so might not only free vs from the euerlasting torments of hell fire, which was the merit of our sins; but also might by the wood of his crosse sweeten these bitter waters, pull out the sting of our temporary afflictions, and so not only make them harmlesse, but also good and profitable. For by his holy and innocent sufferings he hath so sanctified all our afflictions, that our pouerty is made the way to riches, our shame to glory, our punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to euerlasting pleasures, our curse to blessings, and euen our death it selfe to euerlasting life and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse.

To this purpose one saith, thou<note place="margin">Bernard. super. Cantica. Ser. 47</note> O Lord Iesu art vnto me both an example and reward of suffering, and both doe strongly prouoke, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently inflame me; thou teachest my hands to fight by the example of thy fortitude, and after victory thou crownest my head with the presence of thy maiesty; and therefore whether I see thee fighting, or expect thee to crowne me, or rather as the crowne of my glory, in both thou dost wonderfully allure mee, and both is a chaine vnresistable to draw me. Pull me then after thee, &amp; I will gladly follow thee, but more gladly inioy thee; for if thou beest so good, O Lord, to those that seeke &amp; run after thee, what wilt thou be to those who finde and possesse thee? And this is very conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, &amp; agreeable with reason, that none should raigne with Christ, but those who haue first suffered with him: <hi>for the disciple is not aboue his Maister, nor the seruant aboue his Lord: it is enough for the disciple to bee as
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:10735:327"/> his maister is, &amp; the seruant as his Lord. If they haue cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the maister of the house Belzebub, how much more</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Luk. 24. 26.</note> and by his greeuous and manifold sufferings en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into his glory, why should wee expect a preui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge aboue him? It is not sutable and fit that an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted head should haue a pampered body and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers euen languishing in ease and delicacy. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth not the seruant to liue in idlenesse and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, when as the master wearieth himselfe with paines and labour; nor that the Souldier should be in Garison, faring daintily and lying soft, when as the Captaine is in the field, induring all hardnesse, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing himselfe to innumerable dangers. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seeing our head Christ was crowned with prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thornes, let not vs his members expect to be crowned with worldly glory. Seeing our master hath taken such paines, in our worke, and for our sake, and our great Commander hath so couragiously encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred our enemies, fighting vnto blood, and losing his precious life, that we might obtaine the victory: let vs his seruants and souldiers inure our selues with patience to sustaine any labour, and attempt any ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, though neuer so dangerous, which he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that ouercomming, we may also triumph with him in glory and happinesse.</p>
               <p>But this (alas) is aboue the strength and courage
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:10735:327"/> which we haue by nature, where of it commeth to passe that howsoeuer many would gladly be conformable<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 6. That many would willingly raigne with Christ, but few are content to suffer with him.</hi>

But as one saith, if thou<note place="margin">Chrisost. in Heb. 12.

                  <hi>and be made conformable vnto his death,</hi> that by <hi>any meanes thou maiest attaine vnto the resurrection of the dead.</hi> Which that we may doe with patience and comfort, let vs often meditate on those afflictions &amp; miseries which our Lord &amp; Sauior Iesus Christ (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eternall son of God, &amp; so dearly beloued, that in him alone he is well pleased) hath suffered for vs. As for example, when we are in pouerty and pinched with worldly wants, let vs remember that the Lord of heauen and earth, was for our sakes so destitute of earthly comforts, that he had not an house to hide his head in. When we are iniuriously traduced and vniust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:10735:328"/> slandered, let vs call to mind that our Sauiour, who was the Lamb without spot, most innnocent and ful of al goodnesse, was called a wine bibber, a friend to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and sinners, an imposter, and one who did all his miracles by the helpe of Beelzebub the prince of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels. When we are ill requited by those of whom we haue well deserued, forsaken by our friends in the time of our need, and betraied by those who stand obliged vnto vs by many benefits; let vs think with our selues, that our deare Lord was thus vsed before vs; for those sought his destruction whom he came to saue; his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and followers forsake him and flie away in his greatest extremity; and one whom he had dignified with the honor of an Apostle, and among all the men of the world, had chosen for one of the twelue, and honored with his chiefe seruice and choise prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, doth in lue of all his benefits, plot his ruine, and betraieth him into the cruell hands of his blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirsty enemies. Finally are we disgracefully apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, haled to the iudgement seat, falsly accused, vniust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned, buffeted, whipped, mocked, scorned, and adiudged to die a shamefull and painfull death? let vs comfort our selues with this consideration, that the only sonne of God, who aboue all others was most deare to his heauenly father, did suffer these and many other miseries, and hath seasoned and sweetned these bitter waters, by bathing in them his most blessed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And to conclude, are we not only thus afflicted in our bodies and states, but also in our soules much vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and troubled, with the tentations of sathan and the world, with the burthen of sinne, and the apprehension of Gods wrath and terrors of death and hell? then let vs strengthen and refresh our fainting hearts with this meditation, that Christ himselfe was thus tempted, that he bore at once the burthen, not of one mans sinne alone, but of all the faithfull and elect, and did
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:10735:328"/> not only (like vs) taste and sip of the wine of Gods wrath, but did drink the very dregs thereof euen to the bottom. As therfore they were accustomed to prouoke Elephants<note place="margin">1. Mach. 6. 34.</note> vnto the fight, by shewing them the blood of Grapes or Mulberies: so let vs encourage our selues to fight couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously against worldly afflictions, that wee may with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence conquer and ouercome them, by looking on the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, miseries and wounds of our Sauiour, and vpon those streames of blood which so abundātly flowed from his head &amp; shoulders, hands &amp; feet, and lastly frō that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious fountaine of his pierced heart.

Will you take away my children from me? I haue bred and brought them vp for you. Will ye haue any part of my bodie?

For what difficulties and dangers, what excessiue paines and toyle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some labours, doe ambitious men vndertake that they may aspire vnto worldly honours? How are their heads bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with cares, and their hearts with greefes, in plotting the meanes of their preferments, and in beeing crossed in their designes? how doe they beate their braines in study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Machiauells</hi> pollicies, and in contriuing meanes for the ouerthrowing of their enemies, for the supplanting of their competitours, that themselues may rise by their fall, yea for the cunning betraying of those vnto, whom they professe loue &amp; friendship standing in their way, so as they may haue their bane, and yet neuer know who hurt them? With what feares are they racked lest they should be catched in their owne nets? And what sorrowes doe they sustaine, when as they are ouertaken and supplanted by them at whose heeles they tripped? Neither doe men take lesse paines, or vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe fewer dangers, or endure smaller or lighter miseries for the obtaining of the Mammon of iniquitie. The hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band man is vexed with the cold of Winter, and the heate of Sommer. He toyleth in the myre and dirt, and his body

The Merchant trauelleth by sea and land, and is expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to innumerable dangers, to stormes and leakes, to rocks and wracks, to the robberies of mercilesse pyrats, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries of lawlesse barbarians, by many whereof he is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ouertaken, and seldome escapeth them all. And all these paines and dangers he taketh and runneth into, onely in hope of obtaining some riches, of which hee sometimes faileth, running into great losses, whilest hee pursued small gaines; or though hee doe attaine vnto that which he seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, yet is hee as much troubled in the possession, as in the pursuite; and after al his paines in getting, and care in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he is most of all tormented, when as loosing that which is endeared vnto him by induring so much for it, his heart<note place="margin">Quaeris vt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiras, acquiris vt perdas, perdis vt doleas. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard. serm. de quinque negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ationib.</note> lieth open to let in greefe and sorrow. So that (as one saith) by all these excessiue cares, labours and manifold dangers; they seeke to obtaine, obtaine to loose, and loose to greeue. The souldiar to maintaine himselfe in his estate and calling, endures innumerable and greeuous miseries; hee watcheth and wardeth, he lyeth hardly and fareth barely, he runneth desperatly into any dangers, and endureth the incounters of mightie enemies, he is subiect daily to wounds and maimes, and is continually exposed to perill of death; all which hee vndertaketh and sustaineth with courage and comfort, for the gayning of some smal pay, which he no sooner receiueth but hee presently spendeth it; or for the purchase of some smokie honour, the commendation of his Generall, or the applause of his fellow souldiars. So what paines and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doth the seeke man endure, that hee may recouer his impayred health? What cutting and lancing, what serch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and searing, what corasiues and cautarizing, what dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taste
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:10735:332"/> and loathsomnesse doth he endure, whilest he chaweth the pills which he cannot swallow, and whether hee will or no, casteth vp againe the loathed potion? and yet often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he is deceiued of his hope, his medicine being his poyson, which killeth, in stead of curing him. Or though he attaineth vnto that health which he expecteth, it is onely a repriuall from death and no deliuerance; no full freedome from greefes and paines, but a further enabling of him by recouery of strength, to endure them longer. Finally, we see what paines are sustained by ignorant idolaters, and what afflictions and miseries are with patience endured by the blind and superstitious in their will-worship and idolatrous seruice. The Baalits cut and lance themselues before their Idoll; the Papists goe bare-foote on pilgrimages to their i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of Saints, and cruelly whip themselues before their crucifix; many of the Iewes would endure any torments, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they would eate swines flesh; and the Turkes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues would rather dye, then blaspheme their false Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> or lying Alcharon. In a word, worldlings of any sort are content with patience to suffer any miserie for the fruition of their earthly desires, and the pleasing of their<note place="margin">Si tanta suffert anima mundana vt possideat vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de pereat, quanta debet sufferre ne pereat. August. lib. de patient. cap. 6.</note> carnall appetite; and though they are not assured to attaine vnto them, yet the very bare hope of enioying doth lighten all their labours, and sweeten vnto them their most distast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sorrowes. And therefore, if worldly men are content to suffer so many afflictions, that they may obtaine those things which further their destruction, how much more chearfully and patiently should we suffer farre greater cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, that wee may attaine vnto saluation. If they suffer so much for Mammon and things of no worth, let vs be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, to be vnwilling to suffer so much and more for Christ, and the fruition of heauenly happinesse. If they endure so many miseries for temporarie trifles, which they are not sure to obtaine after all their paines and trauailes, nor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them for one houre, though they should haue them in possession; how much rather should wee with ioy and
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:10735:333"/> thankfulnesse endure all crosse and calamities, for the assured fruition &amp; euerlasting possession of God himselfe, and those vnspeakeable ioyes of his heauenly kingdome? It is the lot of the most to suffer many miseries in this life; and (as one saith in this world, not to feare, greeue, labour and bee in<note place="margin">Alia est autem spes piorum, alius laboris fruct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For their torments though neuer so great, are neuertheles finite in their quantity, whereas their losse is infinite, seeing they not onely loose the ioyes of heauen, but the fruition of God himselfe. Now vnto these punishments which they suffer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and properly in their own persons, we may adde those which shall lye vpon them in regard of their company; for besides those hellish fiends and vncleane and filthy spirits, who will be ready to scorne, deride and insult ouer them in their miseries, executing Gods fearefull iudgements with al malicious tyranny, they shall haue the fellowship of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men like themselues, among whom they shall heare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but direfull yelling and hideous crying, shrieking and blaspheming, which will double and redouble their tortures and grieuous paines. All which and much more (which might be spoken of this argument, if it were pertinent to our present purpose) being considered, may serue to lighten all our afflictions, and to yeeld vs comfort in all our crosses, for seeing the Lord of his free grace and infinite mercies, hath through his sonne Christ saued and deliuered vs from these greatest euils, and those intolerable &amp; euerlasting punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, though by nature we are no better then they y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> suffer them, and both by our originall corruption and our actuall transgressions, which we haue innumerable times commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

For as an heauie burthen (which to one alone is vnsupportable) is made light and easie, when as it is borne vpon many shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and as those wounds are most desperatly dangerous, and doe soonest drowne the heart, which doe bleed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and those lesse perilous &amp; sooner cured which haue an outward issue; so the burthen of sorrow which is intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to one onely, is made much more easie when it is borne by diuers friends; and these bloudy streames of tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which hauing no externall vent, will drowne the heart with greefe; when they finde an outward passage into the boosome of a faithfull friend, are easily cured by those soueraigne salues of diuine and morall consolation, which he through his wisdome is able to apply vnto them. And therefore, as when we haue more labour and businesse then we can well by our selues dispatch, we vsually call in others to assist and helpe vs, because labour communicated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth easie to many, which is impossible to one: so when the yoake of affliction doth lye so heauie vpon vs, that in
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:10735:336"/> our owne sense we are readie to faint and sinke vnder it, let vs call in to our aide, our deare and faithfull friends, that by the helpe of their counsailes and comforts, we may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed and supported. And of this wee shall finde a double benefit; first, as it is an ease vnto our hearts, when as they vnburthen themselues of greefe by complaining; for as when the flood of sorrow is pent in &amp; dāmed vp, it so much the more swelleth and inwardly rageth, so when it hath a vent and free current, it will runne much more weakely and with greater stilnesse. In which respect, men to ease them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues are readie to make mone to the bare walls and sensles trees; because, as they are more irkesome when they are smothered, so it is a comfort, if by any meanes they can but vtter them; and secondly, because as sorrow issueth, and the heart emptieth it selfe, so comfort entreth and replenisheth it, whilest our friend to whom we make knowne our cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, doth giue vs ease and refreshing, partly by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, fellow-feeling, condoling and pitying vs in our greefes, and partly by his wise counsails and sweete consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions both diuine and morall.</p>
               <p>But yet we are to knowe, that not euery friend is fit, vnto<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 3. That choice is to be made of a fit friend, when we would commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate our greefes.</hi>

There are some also which being in the contrary extreame are too too sorrowfull and ouer passionate, weeping ouer wounds in stead of curing them; vnto whom sorrow and greefe being imparted by pitifull cryes and mournfull complaints, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choed back againe, and so redoubled both in the sound and strength, like two fires when they meete together. And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:10735:336"/> there are some both faithful and willing, who through their want of wisdome and experience, are not able to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto vs fit comforts; vnto whom we are no more to resor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> for the refreshing of our soules tyred with sorrow, because of their friendship and loue towards vs, then wee doe for the curing of bodily diseases, make choice of vnskilfull empericks because they affect vs; knowing that not loue, but skill and learning doe cure diseases, although they are best when they are ioyned together. And therefore wee are to make choice of such a comforter, as is both compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, temperate in his affections, and wise and discreete in his comforts and counsailes; and not so onely wise, that hee is withall proud and cynicall; nor so onely pitifull and passionate, that hee is fit for nothing; but with the showres of teares to increase the flood of greefe, and to make the streame of sorrow to runne with double violence. And because Gods faithfull ministers are for the most part the best able, and most readie to performe this dutie, who haue receiued from God <hi>the tongue of the learned, that they should knowe to minister a word in time to him that is wearie;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Esa. 50. 4.</note> therefore aboue all others, choise is to be made of them for this purpose, especially when as their knowledge is sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with loue, meeknesse and humilitie; for otherwise it is as good to be without their helpe as haue it, when the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the disease is much exceeded by the paines which they put vs to, in their rude and rough curing it.

               <p>The second meanes of refreshing our hearts oppressed<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 4. The second meanes of worldly comfort, is lawful recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ioyned with our honest labours.</hi>
                  </note> with greefe, is by ioyning seasonably our honest labours with lawfull recreations. For whereas idlenesse giueth full scope and opportunitie vnto Satan and our owne corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to aggrauate and amplifie our afflictions, and gather arguments against our owne peace and contentment, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting our selues with our owne conceipt and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and (as it were) whipping our soules with rodds of our owne making; this serious employment in the businesses of our callings, will put all these conceipts out of our mindes, and free vs from all other greefe, then that which wee are subiect vnto in present sense and feeling. And whereas idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse maketh vs fall into deepe melancholie, by giuing vnto vs full leasure and libertie, not onely to meditate on present miseries, but to recall those which are past, and through feare to anticipate those which are not yet come; the which humour is the very rurse of discontent, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiencie, and the tindar into which when the least sparke of affliction falleth, it is encreased in the apprehension, and within a short time, becomes a great and vnquenchable flame; labour and continuall exercise, doth so wholy take vp the minde, that there is no place for this idle humour to settle in, nor any meanes to nourish it, though at the first we haue giuen way vnto it. But yet excessiue and vnremit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted labour, doth as much prepare the minde for the admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of melancholie, as sloth and idlenesse, and doth no lesse possesse it with impatiencie and discontent; and therefore as the cheefe part of our time must be spent in taking paines, and in performing the duties of pietie and of our callings, to put out of our minds all false apprehensions and idle conceipts; so must wee allot some share thereof vnto honest and lawfull recreations, as walking in pleasant places, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences which are delightfull without offence, Poetrie, Musicke, shooting, and such other allowable sports as best fit with mens seuerall dispositions for their comfort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing. And this is alike, though not equally, necessary as
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:10735:337"/> the other, because as too much ease breedeth wantonnesse; so too much labour causeth wearinesse, of which the one, as well as the other, is the mother and nurse of wawardnesse and impatiencie. But yet we must not at the first approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our afflictions so vse these delights and recreations, that they keepe vs from applying them to our hearts, and making an holy vse of them, for the furthering of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and mortification; as it is the custome of worldly men, who laugh out their sorrowes, discountenance their new approached griefes, drowne their dolour with exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue drinking, and keepe the noise of their afflictions from pearcing their eares or hearts, with the lowder clamour of their merry company; for so they will bee vnto vs as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching Syrens, which will rocke vs a sleepe in carnall se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, bring vs into a spirituall lethargie, and to become senslesse both of smart and sinne: but in the first place wee must giue way vnto God by sorrow for sinne, which is the cause of our afflictions, and vse our crosses, as hammers to driue repentance more deepely into our hearts, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there throughly fixed and fastned, our peace made with God, and the mortall poyson of our miseries (which is sin) being taken away, then wee are by these comforts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations to refresh our mindes, when they are tyred with the waight and continuance of our calamities, in the meane while carefully taking heed, that neither at first nor last, our sports and delights doe not lessen our sorrow for sin, which is alwaies too litle and farre short of that it should be; but onely mitigate our greefe for our miseries and afflictions, which too too often is excessiue and immoderate, for as the salue being rightly applyed to the sore, doth heale and cure it, but being laide vpon the hole skinne, doth draw a blister, and make the patient in worse case then hee was before; so if this medicine of delight and lawfull recreation, be well applyed to that sorrow which ariseth from afflictions, it will do vs much good, and helpe to recouer our spirituall health; because this is a disease of the minde which needeth curing;
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:10735:338"/> whereas if it be misapplied vnto our sorrow for sinne, which is a sauing grace, and one of the soundest parts of a true Christian, it will exulcerate the soule, and make the faithful patient in farre worse estate then he was before.</p>

And now, according to our order first ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally propounded, we are come to speake of such consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as arise from the assurance which wee haue of Gods gracious and most seasonable deliuerance: For though the Lord doth not remoue our afflictions at our owne pleasure; yet hee will doe in his owne good time, when as it shall be most for his owne glory and our spirituall and euerlasting good; though our troubles be tedious, yet he will not suffer them to be endlesse; and though (as the Psalmist speaketh)<note place="margin">Psalm. 118. 18.</note>
                  <hi>he chasteneth vs sore, yet he will not deliuer vs vnto death.</hi> And as the louing Father doth not, when he correcteth his sonne, leaue off at his first motion (for then hee would neither care for him nor his correction) but when hee thinketh the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement sufficient for the reclaiming of him from his faults and vices; so the Lord our heauenly Father heareth our cries in the time of affliction, not according to our lusts &amp; chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish will, but so as in his infinite wisedome hee seeth it to<note place="margin">Act. 16.</note> stand best w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> our profit &amp; the reformation of our former euil courses, which when he seeth effected, he will cast his rodde

Now if our burthen of affliction should bee intolerable, either in respect of the waight or continuance of it, it would not accomplish Gods end, at which hee aymeth in our chastisements, but rather hinder and defeat it, it would not make vs more holy, but rather more wicked and prophane; not more patient, humble, and meeke; but more raging, desperate and wilfull, murmuring and repining against Gods wise prouidence, as though thereby some wrong were offered vnto vs. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Psalmist saith, <hi>that the rod of the wicked shall not rest</hi>

And thus hee was present<note place="margin">Dan. 3. 25.</note> with the three children in the firie furnace, in a visible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, walking with them in the middest of the fire, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing them from sustaining any harme. And thus euen in these dayes hee is present with the faithfull in all their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, though not thus sensibly and miraculously, yet spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually and inuisibly by his wisdome and power, finding out fit meanes for their deliuerance out of all their afflictions, in such a time as is most seasonable.</p>
               <p>The which consideration may serue to replenish our<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 4. Of the consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth from the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of Gods presēce with vs.</hi>
                  </note> hearts with singular comfort, in that hee is alwaies present with vs who is most louing, and best able to giue vs succour and releefe. And therefore the Lord himselfe, when hee would cheere his Church drouping in her afflictions, doth much insist and beat vpon this argument of his gracious presence. <hi>Feare thou not</hi> (saith he) <hi>for I am with thee; be not</hi>

Feare thou not, thou worme Iacob, and ye men of Israel: I will helpe thee, saith the Lord thy redeemer,
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:10735:341"/> the holy one of Israell.</hi> And againe, <hi>Thus saith the Lord that</hi>

                  <hi>created thee, O Iacob, and he that formed thee, O Israell, feare not, for I haue redeemed thee, I haue called thee by name, thou art mine. When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee, and through the floods, that they doe not ouerflow thee. When thou walkest through the very fire, thou shalt not be burnt, neither shall the flame kindle vpon thee.</hi> And thus the Lord encourageth <hi>Paul</hi> to be constant and couragious in all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and afflictions which should happen vnto him, for the preaching of the Gospell. <hi>Feare not</hi> (saith he) <hi>but speake, and</hi>

                  <hi>holde not thy peace, for I am with thee, and no man shall lay hands on thee to hurt thee.</hi> And accordingly thus haue the Saints and seruants of God comforted themselues in al their afflictions, by calling to minde, that the Lord their God was alwaies present with them, to saue and deliuer them out of al their troubles.

                  <hi>and strength, and helpe in troubles readie to be found. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will we not feare, though the earth be moued, and though

                  <hi>hid not my face from shame and spitting; for the Lord God will helpe me, therefore I shall not be confounded: therefore I haue set my face as a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.</hi> According to which examples, let vs labour to cary our selues with comfort and patience in our greatest afflictions, being assured that God is alike present with vs, as hee was with them, to saue and deliuer vs out of all our troubles; for it is better to haue him wrastling with vs like an aduersarie, as he did with <hi>Iacob;</hi> then to be vpon any tearmes without his company, seeing his gracious presence is al-sufficient to sweeten and lighten the bitternesse and burthen of all our crosses, to turne our grones and cryes into the heauenly mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick of praise and thanksgiuing, and to make hel it selfe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp; more delightful, then the cheefest Paradise of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleasures. And therefore because Gods presence is so sweete and comfortable, and hee hath promised to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe it vnto those who are in misery and affliction, some haue desired and beene in loue with their crosses and calamities, though not simply for their owne sakes, yet in this respect, because through Gods gracious promises, they had the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">Da mihi semper tribulationem vt semper possis esse mecū.

To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose one saith, seeing thou hast promised, O Lord, to bee with me in mine afflictions, therefore let mee euer be affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, rather then at any time be without thee. And another. It is better for mee to embrace thee in tribulation, and to haue thee with mee in the fierie fornace of affliction, then enioying all worldly prosperitie, to be without thy compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. And a third making the like profession, saith, It is better for me, O Lord, to be in trouble whilest thou art with mee, then to raigne and reuell, feast and flourish in worldly

               <p>Thirdly, let vs consider, that the Lord who seeth all our<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 5. That Gods pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is omnipotent and al-sufficient to helpe vs.</hi>
                  </note> afflictions, and is alwaies present, and readie to helpe and deliuer vs, is also Omnipotent and Almightie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore able and al-sufficient to saue vs, and to giue vnto vs an happy issue out of all our troubles. For as the Psalmist speaketh, <hi>Who is God besides the Lord? and who is mightie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 18. 31. Iob. 42. 2. Esa. 63. 1.</note>
                  <hi>saue our God. Hee can doe all things</hi> (as <hi>Iob</hi> saith) <hi>and there is nothing hard vnto him. Hee is glorious and walketh in his great strength, hee speaketh in righteousnesse, and is mighty to saue,</hi> as himselfe affirmeth. And therefore the faithfull when they haue been forsaken of all their other hopes, haue notwithstanding rested vpon the Lord in all their troubles and dangers for helpe and deliuerance, as being their onely strength and stay, as wee may see in the example of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Dauid, The Lord▪</hi> (saith he) <hi>is my rock and my for tresse,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 18. 2.</note>
                  <hi>and he that deliuereth me, my God and my strength, in him will I trust; my sheeld, the horne also of my saluation and my refuge.</hi> So the Prophet <hi>Nahum</hi> hauing spoken of the wrath and<note place="margin">Nahum. 1. 6. 7.</note> vengeance that should befall the Assyrians, affirmeth that God would <hi>be good to his Church, and as a strong hold in the day of trouble, knowing them that trust in him.</hi> Yea this the whole Church knew &amp; acknowledged, according to that of the Psalmist, <hi>In the palaces thereof</hi> (that is, of mount Sion)<note place="margin">Psal. 48. 3.</note>
                  <hi>God is knowne for a refuge.</hi> And vpon this ground of kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they exhort one another, to rest vpon the Lord in all troubles for helpe and deliuerance. <hi>Trust in the Lord</hi> (say they) <hi>for euer; for in the Lord God is strength for euer more.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Esa. 26. 4.</note> Now if nothing can be more cōfortable vnto those who are in any danger &amp; distresse, then to be assured y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> their deerest friends are not onely present with them, and beholders of all their greefes; but also haue abilitie and power sufficient to free them from the things they feare, and to deliuer them
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:10735:342"/> out of all difficulties; then ought our hearts much more to bee filled with all ioy and consolation in our greatest affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, seeing we are assured, that the Lord who is infinite in power and loue, is continually present with vs, and both able and readie in the fittest and most seasonable time, to grant vnto vs deliuerance, and freedome from all those crosses and miseries which doe vex and trouble vs.</p>
               <p>Neither are wee onely to comfort our selues in the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance<note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect. 6. That God is most louing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, and therefore wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and readie to helpe vs.</hi>
                  </note> of Gods presence and power to helpe vs, but also of his infinite loue and goodnesse towards vs; the which now commeth in the fourth place to bee considered, as a chiefe and maine argument of our consolation; for if God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all our afflictions, and is neere at hand and readie to help vs; if he be almightie in power, and able to doe for vs what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he will, farre aboue all that wee can aske or thinke, and doth also dearly loue vs, and in regard thereof is still willing to defend vs from euill and to doe vs good, then is there no doubt to be made of Gods helpe, and our deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in his due and most conuenient time. But as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer points appeare plainly by that which hath beene said, so is it easie with the like euidence of truth to demonstrate the infinitnesse and immutabilitie of Gods loue towards vs. For not onely doth he as our Creator, loue vs his creatures<note place="margin">Deut. 7. 6. &amp; 32 9. Tit. 2. 14. 1. Pet. 29.</note> and the workes of his owne hands; but also as our God, Lord and master, who hath made choice of vs aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be his owne peculiar people, subiects of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, members of his Church, and seruants of his familie, vnto whom he sheweth himselfe, and by whom he is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually worshipped and serued. Yea, in farre neerer bonds hath he in his infinite loue and mercy vnited vs vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, for he is our heauenly father, and wee his children by grace and adoption; he is our husband, and we his spouse; yea he is in Christ our head, and we the members of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die; whose loue, mercy and goodnesse towards vs, doe as much exceed that which is to be found in earthly parents, husbands and heads, as himselfe doth exceed them, beeing
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:10735:343"/> infinite and incomprehensible. And this the Scriptures doe plainly declare vnto vs; for thus the Lord himselfe saith to his Church, that he had <hi>loued them with an euerlasting loue, and in mercy had drawne them vnto him,</hi> when being ignorant<note place="margin">Ier. 31. 3.</note> of his excellencie, they made no haste to come. The which his loue, as it is in time endlesle, so it is in quantitie match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, howsoeuer in the Scriptures it hath some resemblances that we might the better conceiue of it. For it is compared to the loue of a father, according to that of the Psalmist. <hi>As a father hath compassion on his children, so will the Lord haue</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psa. 103. 13. Mal. 3. 17.</note>
                  <hi>compassion on them that feare him.</hi> And by the Prophet <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachie</hi> the Lord promiseth, that <hi>he will spare the faithfull, as a man spareth his owne sonne that serueth him.</hi> Yea the loue of<note place="margin">Esa. 49. 15.</note> God is by himselfe compared to the loue of a tender mother, and preferred before it. <hi>Can a woman</hi> (saith he) <hi>forget her childe, and not haue compassion on the sonne of her wombe? though they should forget, yet will I not forget thee. Beholde I</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hos. 2. 19.</note>
                  <hi>haue grauen thee on the palmes of my hands, thy walls are euer in my sight.</hi> Yea he loueth vs as the husband loueth the wife, for he hath <hi>marryed vs vnto himselfe for euer in righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, iudgment, mercy and compassion:</hi> the which his coniugal loue is notably set forth vnto vs in the booke of the Canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. And if we would yet haue a loue aboue this, he loueth vs as the head the members of the body, pitying and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs, as those parts, which being of greatest vse, are also most tender and subiect to iniury. For so the Prophet saith,<note place="margin">Zach. 2. 8. Deut. 32. 10.</note> that he who toucheth <hi>the faithfull, toucheth the apple of Gods eie.</hi> And <hi>Moses</hi> in his song saith, that <hi>God taught his people, and keept them as the apple of his eie.</hi> In assurance of which loue <hi>Dauid</hi> maketh that prayer. <hi>Shew thy meruailous mercies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 17. 7. 8. § <hi>Sect. 7. That God espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially sheweth his loue to the faithfull in the time of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</hi>

                  <hi>O thou that sauest by thy right hand them that trust in thee, from such as rise vp against them. Keepe mee as the apple of the eie, hide me vnder the shadow of thy wings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as God sheweth this his infinite loue vnto the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full at all times, and vpon all occasions, so especially in the time of their troubles and afflictions, and that both by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionating
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:10735:343"/> and as it were condoling with them in their greefes, and also by sauing and deliuering them out of them in due time; for so hee saith of the afflictions of his people,<note place="margin">Esa. 63. 9.</note>
                  <hi>that in all their troubles he was troubled, and the Angell of his presence saued them. That his soule was greeued for the miserie</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iudg. 10. 16.</note>
                  <hi>of Israel;</hi> and that he <hi>earned in the bowels of his compassion,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as himselfe speaketh by his Prophet. <hi>Is Ephraim my deare sonne or pleasant child? For since I spake against him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 31. 20.</note>
                  <hi>I, doe earnestly remember him still. Therefore my bowels are troubled for him, I will surely haue mercy vpon him, saith the Lord.</hi> For this his loue and compassion cannot be idle; but as it will shew it selfe in pitying the miseries and troubles of<note place="margin">vers. 9.</note> his children, so also in giuing vnto them seasonable helpe and deliuerance. For so he saith of the same people, and in them of al the faithful. <hi>They shall come weeping, and with mercy will I bring them againe. I will lead them by the riuers of waters, in a straight way wherein they shall not stumble; for I am a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnto Israel, and Ephraim is my first borne.</hi> And so the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Church speaketh out of her owne experience. <hi>The Lord will not forsake for euer. But though he send affliction, yet</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lam. 3. 31. 32. 33.</note>
                  <hi>will he haue compassion, according to the multitude of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; for he doth not punish willingly, nor afflict the children of men;</hi> yea contrariwise, hee taketh the greatest delight in shewing his mercy and goodnesse to those who serue and depend vpon him, as being an action most naturall and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar vnto him, according to that of the Prophet <hi>Micah.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Micah. 7. 18.</note>
                  <hi>Who is a God like vnto thee, that taketh away iniquity, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psa. 103. 14.</note>
                  <hi>by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth not his anger for euer, because mercy pleaseth him.</hi> All which his mercy and goodnesse hee is aboue all other times most ready to extend towards vs in the time of our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in regard of our weaknesse to beare these burthens; for hee knoweth <hi>whereof we be made, and remembreth that we</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Esa. 53. 3.</note>
                  <hi>are but dust, and he hath experience of our infirmities,</hi> as the Prophet speaketh, knowing what to lay vpon vs, and the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test time to ease vs of our burthen. The which may serue as
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:10735:344"/> a singular consolation vnto vs in all our troubles and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, in that the Lord who is almighty and most able to helpe vs, is also infinite in loue and compassion towards vs, and therefore alwaies ready and willing to giue vnto vs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance in time most conuenient. For if the childe so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeth on his Fathers loue, that hauing also power in his hand to supply his wants, protect him from dangers, &amp; free him from any euill, he comfortably resteth vpon him in his greatest pouerty and misery; If the beloued wife so trusteth in her husbands loue, that shee careth not to haue much in her owne keeping, so she be assured that he hath inough for both, nor feareth any enemy in his presence which she know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he is able to resist and ouercome; nor is much troubled with any present paine or sicknesse, if she be perswaded, that he at pleasure can giue her ease by curing of it; And finally if the members of the same body doe securely rest vpon the wife prouidence and direction of the head, and when it so appointeth are content with meekenesse and patience to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure any paine or torture, as binding, lancing searching, searing, for the helping and healing of their infirmities and sores, because by naturall instinct they know, that it wil im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose vpon them no more then necessary paines, seeing in all their troubles and vexation it doth condole with them: then how much more should wee in all our afflictions and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries rest and relye vpon Gods aide and assistance with secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, comfort and spirituall ioy, seeing we can make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of his power and ability to deliuer vs, and may be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he infinitely more loueth vs, then the most louing father his onely sonne, the kindest husband his dearest wife, or the naturall head the true members of his owne body.</p>
               <p>Lastly, let vs consider, that the Lord is not onely power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 8. Consolation ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from Gods gracious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of helpe and deliuerance.</hi>

                  </note> our deliuerance out of all our afflictions; which are not grounded vpon our works, merits, worthinesse, or any thing which is in vs; but vpon God his all-seeing knowledge, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious presence, power, loue and truth; which beeing things without vs, cannot bee crossed by our sinnes and vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, if we performe that condition of faith, laying holde on these mercies and gracious promises of God, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the fruits of repentance, whereby wee bewaile, hate and forsake all those sinnes, which haue mooued the Lord to inflict vpon vs all these crosses and afflictions. Now vnto these arguments of comfort arising from our assurance of deliuerance, let vs adde breefly some examples of the faithful from time to time, who hauing trusted in God, haue in his due time beene saued and deliuered out of all their troubles and afflictions. And thus we read, that God saued <hi>Noah</hi> and his familie from perishing in the vniuersal deluge, and <hi>Lot</hi> from the common destruction of Sodome and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah. Thus he freed <hi>Abraham</hi> from the danger of loosing either his life or wife, by plaguing the heathenish kings, and also of loosing his sonne, by prouiding in an instant another sacrifice to bee offered in his place. And thus hee deliuered <hi>Iacob</hi> from the grieuous seruitude of churlish <hi>Laban,</hi> as also from the mischiefes which hee intended against him at his departure; from the armed malice of his brother <hi>Esau,</hi> and out of innumerable other afflictions and dangers, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in his story. So how graciously did the Lord deliuer <hi>Ioseph</hi> from the bloudy conspiracy of his brethren, making their malice to serue his prouidence, as a meanes of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment; as also out of all those miseries into which he was deepely plunged through the lustful rage and false slaunders of his dishonest mistresse? how miraculously did hee deliuer <hi>Moses</hi> in his infancy from killing, drowning and staruing; and in his mature age from the malitious intendments of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the Aegyptians, as also from the mutinings and often rebellions of the vngratefull Israelites: What an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:10735:366"/> issue did he make for <hi>Iob</hi> out of all his troubles? and how meruaylously did hee protect <hi>Dauid</hi> from the Philistines, from the persecutions raised against him by <hi>Saul,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious treason of his owne sonne? how did he manifest his omnipotent power and watchfull loue, in preseruing <hi>Elias</hi> from the malicious rage of <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Iesabell,</hi> in feeding him by the ministery of his Angell, and afterwards by the rauens, and the poore widdow; in safe-guarding <hi>Elizaeus</hi> from the army of the Aramites, and the bloody designe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his owne vngratefull King? in preseruing the three children in the fiery furnace. <hi>Daniell</hi> in the Lions den, <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> in the whales belly; and <hi>Ezechias</hi> from the mighty hoast of <hi>Senacherib,</hi> and afterward from the iawes of death when as it was ready to seaze vpon him? yea how wonderfully did he deliuer the whole people and church of Israell; first out of the bondage of Aegypt, and afterwards in the time of the Iudges from the subiection and oppression of their many and mighty enemies, as from the Amorites, Ammonites,<note place="margin">Iud. 10. 11. 12.

So likewise out of the captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Babylon; and from the most cruell conspiracie of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> whereby he intended at once, to roote them out from being a people. Finally, in the new Testament, when as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse he was purposed to make the blood of his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres the seed of his Church, yet till the appointed time came, how strongly and powerfully did hee preserue them from the crueltie and malice of the Scribes, Pharisies, and the rest of the Iewes, deliuering <hi>Peter, Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> out of prison by the ministerie of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

To which I answere. First, that all Gods seruants haue deliuerance out of their afflictions in due time, whether it bee by life or death; and therefore seeing our longest liues are short and momentany, beeing compared with that euerlasting happinesse which is to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after, the time of our afflictions cannot be long, nor our deliuerance farre off, although it should bee deferred to the day of dissolution. Whereas contrariwise the punishments of the wicked being begunne, doe neuer end, their earthly miseries leading and bringing them into those euerlasting and hellish torments. Secondly, I answere, that Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of deliuerance from temporarie afflictions are not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, but alwayes to be vnderstood with this conditiion, if it will stand with his owne glory, and the spirituall good and saluaiton of the parties vnto whom hee maketh them. For otherwise our freedome from affliction would be no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, but the greatest hurt, Gods promise would degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into a threatning, bringing vnto vs euill in stead of good, and it would proue vnto vs the greatest crosse, not to

Now often times Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and our saluation, are more aduanced by the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, then by the remouall of our crosses; as when God tryeth by them his graces in vs, that hee may afterwards crowne them, and causeth our sight to be so much more long and dangerous, that accordingly our ensuing victorie may bee the more glorious; or when hee doth vse them either for an hedge to keepe vs from leaping into the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden pastures of carnall pleasures; or fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

And therefore in all our crosses and calamities wee are to comfort our selues in this assurance, that if it will stand with Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the euerlasting good of our soules, wee shall most certainely obtaine deliuerance; or otherwise, if it bee better for vs in these respects, that wee should continue in them, then will the Lord assuredlie giue vnto vs such strength, patience and inward comforts of his spirit, as shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Neither doth the Lord shoote his most pearcing bullets of tentations against his weakest armour, which would but disgrace his workmanship, and in mortall manner wound the wearer; but he dischargeth them onely against such as hee hath made high proofe, which repell the shot without harme, and set forth the skill of him that made it. Hee will not lay a great waight vpon weake shoulders, which would crush them downe and make them vnprofitable for vse, but he loadeth those with the heauiest burthen, whom he hath first enabled with sufficient strength. He will not leane too
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:10735:371"/> hard vpon his brused reedes, nor cast water vpon his new kindled fire, which he would haue encrease to a great flame; but he putteth to the greatest stresse his most solid timber and heart of oke, and casteth these waters of triall vpon such a throughly inflamed zeale, as is but the more encreased in heate by this opposition and reluctation. And thus the Lord dealt with <hi>Abraham,</hi> the father of the faithfull; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made many notable promises vnto him and his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, hee kept him a long time without any issue, and hauing assured him, that in his seed both himselfe and al the nations of the earth should be blessed; hee exercised his faith in this promise, by deferring the accomplishment thereof, vntill he was growne so olde that it seemed impossible in nature to be performed. So he gieth <hi>Iacob</hi> the blessing, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth him the land of Canaan in possession, but afterwards he is faine to waite for the accomplishment twentie yeares, as a stranger and seruant in another countrey. Hee promiseth <hi>Ioseph</hi> many priuiledges, and the soueraigntie ouer his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, but in the meane while they vse him at their pleasure, they sell him for a slaue into Aegypt, where hee passeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dangers, and endureth many miseries, before hee seeth any likely-hood of the performance of Gods promise. And finally, thus he vsed <hi>Dauid,</hi> a man according to his own hart, for after that hee had chosen him for King ouer his people, and had assured him by his promise, that he should sit vpon the royal throne, he deferreth the accōplishment thereof for many years, in the meane while exposing him to the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his enemies, and to such innumerable troubles and tentations, that his faith sometimes receiued foyles, and brought into question the truth of Gods word. And this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in many places of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>, Psalmes, where he maketh these<note place="margin">Psa. 13. 1.</note> and such like cōplaints. <hi>How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord, for euer? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me? How long shal I take consel within my selfe, hauing wearines daily in mine hart? how long shall mine enemies be exalted about me?</hi> Yea, he crieth out as one vtterly cast off; <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me▪ and art so farre from my health, and from the

                  <hi>tender mercies in displeasure? and I said, this is my death.</hi> Yea, so was his faith shaken with these long delayes, that <hi>he said in his feare all men</hi> (and among the rest the Prophet <hi>Samuel,</hi> who had reported vnto him Gods promises of the crowne and kingdome) <hi>were but lyars</hi> and deceiuers; and professeth<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 123.</note> that <hi>his eie failed in expecting Gods saluation, and the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of his iust promise.</hi> And euen thus the Lord deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the faithfull in these dayes; for howsoeuer when we are babes in Christ, and weake in faith, he will not break the brused reede, nor quench the smoking flax, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is pleased to performe his promises speedily, and to encourage vs in his seruice with the liberall wages of his rich and plentiful benefits; yet when we are growne strong in grace, and are endued with a great measure of faith, affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, hope and patience, he will not lay light burthens vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our able shoulders, nor exercise these giftes with his slightest trials; but he will proue vs with great and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tentations, and seeme to leaue vs in them without helpe and deliuerance for a long time together. And therefore, when this befalleth vs, wee are not to bee discomfited and discouraged, yea rather we are to reioyce in these trials and afflictions, seeing they are signes of Gods greater loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, and that hee hath vouchsafed vnto vs a greater measure of his gifts and graces; and comfortably to attend Gods good leasure for our deliuerance, seeing we know that <hi>the Lord delighteth in them that feare him, and attend vpon</hi>

For so himselfe speaketh. <hi>I waited patiently</hi> (saith<note place="margin">Psa. 101. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Whereas on the other side we bewray our incredulitie, when wee will not hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully waite vpon God, for the accomplishment of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, but couet in post haste to haue our desires satisfied; resoluing that if God will not giue vs lawfull meanes of freedome from danger, or deliuer vs out of our afflictions when we would haue him; that wee will no longer attend his leisure, but vse such meanes as are next hand, not waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or regarding whether they be lawfull or vnlawfull, so they be but likely to satisfie our desires in the remouall of our crosses. And of this haste wee haue an example in <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,</hi> who professeth in plaine tearmes that hee would not<note place="margin">2. King. 6. 33.</note> attend on the Lord any longer then pleased him, but would vse his owne meanes for his deliuerance. And in many men who liue in these dayes, who will not waite on Gods leasure for their recouery of health, but send to witches and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards; nor for the repairing of their poore estates in the vse<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 7.

               <p>Fifthly, vs consider, that if the Lord deferreth to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his promises for our deliuerance, hee doth it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is vnable or vnwilling to helpe vs, or because he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth any delight in our miseries and afflictions; but as hee doth at the first inflict vpon vs these trials and chastize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:10735:373"/> for our spirituall good and the furthering of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting saluation; so he onely continueth them so long as is fit for the effecting and perfecting of these his gracious ends. As for example hee afflicteth vs for our triall, that his graces vouchsafed vnto vs may bee exercised and manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted to the glory of him that gaue them; and encreasing of the happinesse of those that haue them; and therefore if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the renewing of our faith and serious and sound repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, our crosses are continued, we may be assured that the Lord is pleased to vse further as the instruments of his glory, and that he is purposed by continuing the conflict to magnifie our victory, and to make our crown much more glorious. Sometimes also he afflicteth vs, that heere by our sinnes and corruptions may be mortified and subdued, and we purged and purified by this fiery triall: and therefore if after much praying and earnest suing wee are not freed, wee are to knowe that the drosse of corruption is not yet suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently consumed, and wee refined and purified, seeing the Lord continueth vs still in this fiery furnace; and that the sores of sinne are not yet cured, nor the core of corruption yet drawne out, seeing ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> skilfull and louing Chirurgeon doth still cause these corrasiues to be applyed vnto vs. More especially he vseth these bitter medicines to weane vs from the loue of the world and worldly vanities; and therefore if after much loathing and complaining we are still compelled to taste of them, we may hence conclude, that our loue and affection still too much doteth on these earthly things, and that we haue as yet a desire to suck this hurtfull milke, and to returne vnto these poysonous brests, if the Lord did not still annoint them with the woremewood and gall of these temporarie afflictions. So the Lord doth afflict vs, that his sanctifying and sauing graces may bee confirmed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased in vs; and therefore if they are still continued vpon vs after we haue often sued for helpe and deliuerance, let vs know that we haue not as yet profited by them as we ought, and that in infinite loue the Lord will not leaue vs, vntill
<pb n="700" facs="tcp:10735:374"/> hee haue brought vs to greater perfection. More especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie wee are corrected by the Lord, that by his chastizements our faith, repentance and obedience might be encreased, and therefore if after earnest suite we are not eased of them, wee may assure our selues, that our faith yet needeth more exercise, and longer and greater experience of Gods loue, power and truth, in moderating our afflictions and suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vs with the power of his might, that we may be able to beare thē; &amp; that we haue not yet, as we ought, bewailed our former sinnes, hated our present corruptions, nor firmely (as we should) resolued to labour in the vse of the meanes for the mortifying &amp; subduing them; and for the time to come, to serue the Lord in holinesse and righteousnes, with zeale, integritie and vprightnes of heart. Finally, the Lord bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs into these dangerous straights of trouble and misery, that we may flee vnto him by harty praier for helpe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance; and therefore if we haue already praied often, and are not yet heard according to our desires, let vs perswade our selues, that the Lord stoppeth not his eares to our suits, but seeing that we are cold and negligent in solliciting of them, hee doth by these seeming refusals and temporary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulses, but make vs the more feruent and earnest in suing for his helpe, and in begging such benefits and deliuerances, as are much endeared vnto vs by his momentany denials and our owne wants; as it notably appeareth in the example<note place="margin">Matth. 15. 22. 23.</note> of the woman of Canaan, who receiued at Christs hands di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers sore repulses, not because he was purposed to deny her request, but because hee would haue her prosecute it with greater earnestnesse, to which purpose one saith, that God in<note place="margin">

                  </note> tribulation stirring vp the faith to aske, and himselfe defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to grant, doth not deny his aide, but only intendeth our desire. And therefore if being impatient of our crosses wee should immoderatly couet to haue them remoued before we haue by them attained vnto these ends, wee doe in effect<note place="margin">Ier. 2. 30.</note> desire that our corrections should become (like those of the Israelits) vaine and fruilesse. If we should sue to haue the
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:10735:345"/> plaisters remoued, and the bitter potions taken away, before our sores and sicknesse of sinne be healed and cured, wee doe thereby desire that the Lord would giue vs ouer as a desperate cure, and leaue vs to rotte and perish in our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases and corruptions.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, let vs consider that the Lord oftentimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 8.

                  <hi>body, which was now dead, being almost an hundred yeare old, nor the deadnesse of Saraes wombe, but tarying patiently, he did at length enioy the promise.</hi> So hee promised the people of Israell that hee would bring them out of Aegypt, and giue them possession of the Land of Promise; but this hee performeth not whilest <hi>Pharaoh</hi> liued, who was their
<pb n="702" facs="tcp:10735:346"/> friend, when as in reason there might haue beene some likely-hood of it, but when they were most endangered to the rage and malice of their tyrannicall enemies, and had no appearance of hope to be freed out of that cruell bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, or to shake that iron yoake from off their necks. And thus afterwards hee deliuered them from the captiuitie of<note place="margin">Zach. 3. 2.</note> Babylon, not when they were in their cheefe floure and strength, and able to make some shift for themselues; but when their case was vtterly desperate, the Lord freed them out of this misery, plucking them (as the Prophet speaketh) like <hi>firebrands out of the fire.</hi> So hee saued <hi>Dauid</hi> when hee<note place="margin">Psa. 22. 1.</note> seemed vnto himselfe vtterly forsaken, and deliuered him out of the hands of <hi>Saul,</hi> not by keeping him farre off from danger, but when hauing inuironed him about with a strong army, he was euen ready to seaze vpon him. And thus our<note place="margin">1. Sam. 23. 26</note> Sauiour being in the ship with his disciples, did seeme to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect them in their greatest danger, and did not awake out of sleepe, nor arise to deliuer them, til the ship was couered<note place="margin">Mar. 4. 37. 38.</note> with waues, and ready to sinke. And afterwards he suffered them to be tossed with a tempest, and by his miraculous walking on the sea to be astonished with feare; and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought into the last extremity, and past hope of esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping out of dāger, he giueth vnto them comfort, by assuring them of his presence. Finally he would not preserue <hi>Lazarus</hi> life by going vnto him in the time of his sicknesse, nor yet<note place="margin">Ioh. 11. 6.</note> when hee was newly dead and buried, but hee purposely staieth from him foure daies at the least, after his death, and then goeth and raiseth him to life. Neither did hee by his Angell deliuer <hi>Peter</hi> out of prison presently after he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, but the very night before that <hi>Herode</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to proceed to his execution, when as he was strongly guarded betweene two soulidiars, bound with chaines, and had the keepers besides, waiting before the prison dore▪ euen then when all hope was past to naturall reason, hee saued and deliuered him out of that imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And so to conclude this pointe with an example
<pb n="703" facs="tcp:10735:346"/> which is fresh in memory, the Lord saued vs from the gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder treason, not by discouering it when it was first plotted, but euen a few houres before it should haue beene put in execution, when as in humaine reason it was much more likely to haue beene still concealed, then to haue beene kept secret so long before, especially considering that besids those who were actors in this tragedie, they had so many lookers on, who were well acquainted with their courses and proceedings. The which experience of Gods mercy and power in deliuering vs and others, out of most desperate dangers, should moue vs still to depend and waite patiently vpon God in all our troubles and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not onely when wee haue any likely-hood of helpe, but when we seeme past all hope of recouery, seeing euen then the Lord is as able and readie to saue and deliuer vs out of these miseries; and will assuredly doe it in his good tyme, if it will stand with his owne glory, our spirituall good and the euerlasting saluation of our bodies and soules. And therefore in our greatest extremities, let this conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration moue vs to waite vpon God, and raising and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging our deiected and fainting mindes, let vs say with the Psalmist, <hi>Why art thou cast downe my soule, and vnquiet</hi>

<pb n="704" facs="tcp:10735:347"/> much more should we waite that we may be partakers of it. If hee be content to watch for the most conuenient time of deliuering vs out of trouble, and will not when it is come deferre his helpe (for who waiteth longer then hee must needs, and who that is wise letteth passe his best opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of doing that good which hee entendeth?) then how much more should wee watch and waite with patience and comfort till this seasonable time come, when as it is best and fittest, that this promised mercy should be emparted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs. Furthermore, let vs consider, that our greatest and<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 35.</note> longest afflictions shall not bee able to separate vs from the infinite and euerlasting loue of God, as the Apostle telleth vs; but as in loue hee beganne to correct vs, so in the same loue he continueth our chastisements, that he may by morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying our sinne preserue vs from condemnation, and by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting his gifts and graces in vs, make vs fit for his euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting kingdome; being euer ready in his tender compassion to vphold and strengthen vs in our greatest conflicts, and to giue vs victory by deliuering vs from them, when as it shall be most seasonable for our profit and best aduantage. Finally, let vs remember, that though our crosses and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in this world be exceeding grieuous and tedious, yet<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 32</note> they are light and momentany in comparison of those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable tortures and euerlasting torments of hell fire, from which the Lord in his infinite goodnesse hath saued vs; vsing for this purpose the afflictions and sufferings of his deare sonne, as the onely meritorious cause, and our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons who are the members of this body, as an inferiour, yet effectuall meanes of our freedome from these euils. And on the other side, let vs call to minde those vnspeakable and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ioyes which wee shall come vnto by this rough and thornie way of afflictions; which can in no comparison bee<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 18.</note> matched with our miseries; <hi>For the afflictions of this present world, are not worthy the glory which shall be reuealed,</hi> seeing, they being <hi>light and momentanie, doe cause vnto vs, a farre most excellent and eternall waight of glory,</hi> and being tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable<note place="margin">2.

Secondly, it is Gods maine end in correcting vs, to bring vs by his chastisements vnto vnfained repentance, and therefore if impenitently we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in our sinnes, wee cannot waite vpon God for helpe and deliuerance, seeing so he should be frustrate of his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall end, but may iustly expect that hee will double and redouble our afflictions, vntill according to his purpose he hath brought vs vnto repētance &amp; amendement; vnlesse we be in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> number of those whom he giueth ouer as a desperate cure, reseruing them for euerlasting and hellish condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So one saith, that God can this present day free and<note place="margin">Chrysost. ad Pop Antioch. Homil. 4. de patientia.</note> deliuer vs out of all our afflictions, but he will not doe it till he see vs purged and purified from our sinnes, soundly, conuerted from our euill wayes, and our repentance not only begun, but well setled and throughly confirmed in vs. And as the gold-smith will not take his gold out of the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, vntill he see that it is well purified from the drosse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this was the end why he cast it in; so the Lord will not deliuer vs out of this furnace of afflictions, vntill the drosse of sinne bee by our repentance purged away, because this was the end that moued him to cast vs into it. Thirdly, wee must knowe and remember that our sinnes are the causes of our afflictions, and therefore till they be taken away by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained repentance, we can haue no hope of the remouall of our crosles; for as the fire must needs burne vs which we ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in our boosomes vnlesse it bee cast out, or extinguished with water, because it is an effect which inseparably accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panieth it very essence and nature; so will this fire of sinne continually scorch vs with the heate of punishment, seeing they cannot be seuered asunder, vnlesse we doe put out and extinguish them, by casting vpon them the water and teares
<pb n="709" facs="tcp:10735:349"/> of vnfained repentance. Fourthly, sinne is the sting of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which being pulled out, they become harmelesse; but if it still remaine in them, it will infuse into them such a tormenting and deadly poyson, that the paine will grow intolerable, and impossible to be endured with any pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. It doth exceedingly wound and weaken our faith, making vs to doubt of Gods loue towards vs, seeing wee shew in our obedience so small fruits of loue towards him; which wounds will not be cured till sin the sting that made them be pulled out, and the sores washed and bathed by vnfained repentance. And the guilt of sin is vnto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science an intolerable burthen, which being added to the burthen of afflictions cannot possibly be sustained with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane strength; &amp; therefore is no way able to beare thē with patience, vnlesse we lighten our loade, casting away sinne that presseth downe, by turning vnto God in vnfained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. And then bearing no burthen of our owne impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, but that alone which God layeth vpon vs, wee shall easily sustaine it with comfort and contentment, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is light in waight, as the Apostle telleth vs, and also wee haue assured hope by Gods gracious promises, that within a short time we shall be freed from it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hauing thus renewed our repentance, wee are<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 3. The second duty is often to renew our faith in Gods promises.</hi>
                  </note> in the next place to renew our faith, applying vnto our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues all the gracious promises of the Gospell, made vnto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant sinners, especially those which concerne the free forgiuenesse of sinne, both in respect of the guilt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and our deliuerance out of all our afflictions and calamities in Gods due &amp; appointed time, when as it will most stand with his glory and the euerlasting good of our owne soules. Whereby our faith beeing renewed and strengthened, we shall be the better enabled hopefully to expect the performance of Gods promises, although the things promised be not subiect to sight, and aboue the reach of naturall reason, for as the Apostle saith; <hi>Faith is the ground</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 1.</note>
                  <hi>of things which are hoped for, and the euidence of things which
<pb n="710" facs="tcp:10735:350"/> are not seene.</hi> And although God tryeth vs with many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes, yet we will patiently attend his leisure; for as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet speaketh, <hi>He that beleeueth shall not make haste;</hi> because<note place="margin">Esa. 28. 16.</note> he is assured by faith, that though hee haue not from God helpe and deliuerance, when he first desireth it, yet hee shall most assuredly obtaine it, when as it will tend to his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est benefite.</p>
               <p>The third meanes whereby we may be enabled to waite<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 4. The third dutie is true humility, whereby we meekely submit our selues to Gods good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</hi>
                  </note> vpon God, when hee deferreth to accomplish his promises, and to deliuer vs out of our troubles and afflictions, is to labour after true humilitie, whereby knowing and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging our owne ignorance, which maketh vs vnable to discerne truely what is good or hurtfull for vs, we do wholy deny our selues and our owne wisdome, and resigne our selues ouer freely and wholy vnto God, to be ruled and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by him, as he thinketh good, whether it be to liue in prosperitie or affliction, plentie or pouertie, health or sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, life or death, being perswaded, that hee is infinite in wisdome, and knoweth what is best, infinite in power, and therefore able to bring it to passe maugre the malice and might of all opposers, and infinite also in loue and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and therefore willing and ready to doe that which in his wisdome he seeth to bee fittest for vs. And this ground of patience the Apostle propoundeth, where hee saith, that <hi>the Lord knoweth to deliuer the godly out of tentation,</hi> that is, he so knoweth, that he also both can and wil powerfully ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 9.</note> it. Vpon which foundation we must also build our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and comfort, when as wee continue long in trouble and affliction, and being perswaded of Gods infinite wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, power and loue, let vs resigne our selues wholy to his good will and pleasure, knowing that nothing euer misca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried which was intrusted to his care and prouidence. And though our afflictions bee tedious and bitter to flesh and blood, yet let vs patiently endure that which he in his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and goodnesse is pleased to inflict, neither prescribing vnto him the measure of our afflictions (for it is absurd and
<pb n="711" facs="tcp:10735:350"/> ridiculous for the childe to make choice of his rod, and to appoint vnto his father what number of stripes he shal giue vnto him) nor the meanes by which we would be deliuered, which are better knowne to God then vnto vs; nor finally, the time of our troubles, how long they shall last, and when we would haue him to free vs from them. For so wee shall but fall into a dangerous premunire, and make forfeiture of our spirituall estate, by encroaching vpon Gods royall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges and prerogatiues, seeing our office and dutie is<note place="margin">Nostri est crucē ferre, Dei vero auferre. Nosse enim quando tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones auferri o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteat illius est qui eas permisit inferri.

According to the saying of an ancient father; to know (saith he) the time when our tribulation and afflictions are to be taken from vs, it belongeth to him who hath inflicted them but to beare them meekly with thanksgiuing, it is the proper work of our patience. And if we thus meekly submit our selues to the will of God, it will heereof come to passe, that both we shall beare our greatest afflictions with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter comfort and contentment, then worldly men the least defects of their earthly prosperitie; and also that wee shall much the sooner bee freed from them, seeing our gracious father will no longer smite and beate vs, when as hee seeth vs already throughly humbled, vnlesse it be in the case of triall, for the▪ better manifestation of his graces in vs, that hereafter he may crowne them with the greater glory.</p>
               <p>The fourth meanes, enabling vs to waite vpon God in<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 5. The fourth duty is to trust in God at all times, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our▪ meanes.</hi> Iob. 13. 15.</note> trouble and affliction, is to worke our hearts vnto firme af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance in him in all estates and conditions, that we may say with <hi>Iob, Though he kill me, yet will I trust in him;</hi> and that both in the presence and absence of inferiour meanes. For if in our crosses and calamities, we doe not as we ought looke vnto God, but rest in the helpe of our worldly hopes and secondary causes; it is not possible to preserue our patience, seeing they will through vnfaithfulnesse bewray vs when we trust in them, through impotencie and insufficiency faile vs, when we rest vpon them, and when they haue pulled vs vp (as we were) sinking to the top of the waters, and wee
<pb n="712" facs="tcp:10735:351"/> thinke our selues escaped out of the danger, they will let goe their hold for want of strength, or wilfully thrust vs back againe into the gulfe of destruction, whereas if our whole affiance and confidence bee in the Lord and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised helpe, wee shall be well freed from the violence of passion, and neither bee much lifted vp with hope in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of earthly helpes, because we know, that if he do but blowe vpon them, they doe presently vanish; nor deie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with feare and despaire, when as they faile and forsake vs, because wee are assured, that God in whom wee trust, is able to deliuer vs without them, by his al-sufficient power, or else can when hee pleaseth prouide vs other meanes in their stead, which are more conuenient and better able to helpe vs. Let vs therefore in all our afflictions put our trust in the Lord, saying with the Church when he deferreth his helpe. <hi>Be not terrible vnto me, thou art my hope in the day of aduersitie.</hi> And againe, <hi>Giue vs helpe against trouble, for vaine</hi>

                  <hi>thou hast heard me, and hast been my deliuerance.</hi> The which vowes of thankesgiuing, the Lord himselfe requires, <hi>Offer vnto God praise, and pay thy vowes vnto the most high.</hi> And therefore seeing these thankes and praise are the maine end of our deliuerances, which both God and the faithfull doe cheefly aime at, let vs carefully endeauour to attaine vnto it; for by the rule of reason the end is alwaies better then that which is destinated vnto it; and consequently if we must e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme our deliuerance it selfe, by which we are freed from all our troubles; much more accompt are we to make of the praises of God, and our thanksgiuing after that we are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped; seeing it is the end for which God deliuereth vs, and we desire to be deliuered. And as in the time of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction we are diligent in prayer, and earnest suiters vnto God for his helpe and aide; so hauing obtained it, let vs be as forward and ready to returne vnto him thanks and praise for his mercy and goodnesse. For otherwise we shall disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnto God and our owne consciences most shamefull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, in that being such bare banke-rupts, that we haue nothing to returne vnto God for all his benefits, wee will not remaine thankfull debters; and hauing nothing else to render vnto him for all his mercies, we will not so much as yeeld vnto him praise and thanks. Yea, wee shall plainely proue, that we are not in the number of Gods faithfull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whose constant practise in all ages hath bin, to magnifie and glorifie the holy name of God, when they haue beene deliuered out of any afflictions, as it plainly appeareth in so many places of the sacred Scriptures; that it is but lost time to insist vpon them.</p>
               <pb n="716" facs="tcp:10735:353"/>
               <p>Now this thankfulnesse whereby we glorifie God, for his<note place="margin">§ <hi>Sect. 8. What kinde of thankefulnesse is to be offered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for our deliuerance.</hi>
                  </note> gracious deliuerance of vs out of trouble and affliction, is not to be onely formall and externall, but is first and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to be seated in our minds and hearts, wherein we are perpetually to retaine a gratefull remembrance of Gods mercy towards vs, with a resolued purpose and intention in all things to glorifie his holy name, when as any occasion is offered or may be taken by vs. For the Prophet <hi>Malachie</hi> threatneth a curse against the Priests which was to fall vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">Mal. 2. 2.</note> them, if they did <hi>not consider, or put it in their heart to giue glory vnto the Lord.</hi> And the Apostle exhorteth vs in all things to intend and aime at Gods glory, <hi>Whether</hi> (saith he)<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 31.</note>
                  <hi>ye eate or drinke, or whatsoeuer ye doe, doe all to the glory of God.</hi> But yet this thankfulnesse is not wholy to be reserued (as it were) in the close prison of our owne brests, for so God should lose the glory, our neigbours a good example, and we faile in the performance of our dutie, but it is also to be professed with our mouthes, and our profession to be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by our workes and actions. In our speaches we are to declare what great things the Lord hath done for vs, to magnifie his mercies for our deliuerances out of trouble, and to praise his holy name in Psalmes, Hymnes and spirituall<note place="margin">Col. 3. 16</note> songs, sweetning the musicke of the voice with the harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious melody of our hearts. And because the Lord is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, not onely in his praises, according to the saying in the Psalmes, <hi>He that sacrificeth praise, doth glorifie me;</hi> but<note place="margin">Psa. 50. 23.</note> also in all our holy communications, and in our religious, honest and sauoury speaches; therefore wee must acquaint our tongues with the language of Canaan, and auoiding all corrupt and vprofitable words, we must set a watch before<note place="margin">Col. 4. 6. Ephes. 4. 29.</note> the dore of our lips, and carefully take heed that our speach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es be so powdred with the salt of wisdome and holinesse, that they may not onely glorifie God, but also tend to the edification of those that heare vs. Finally, because thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse professed is not sufficient, vnlesse it be also approued by our workes of godlinesse and sanctification; therefore
<pb n="717" facs="tcp:10735:353"/> we must endeauour also that our <hi>lights may so shine before</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 5. 16.</note>
                  <hi>men, that seeing our good works, they may glorifie our father in heauen.</hi> And to this end let vs take heed that wee doe not dimme or dazle this light, by ouershadowing it with the black cloude of sin and wickednesse; but especially let vs la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to mortifie those corruptions, and to forsake those sins, which our owne consciences doe condemne to be the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest causes of our late afflictions, lest lying and liuing still in our sinnes, and impenitently going forward in our former euill courses, we fall into a relapse of Gods escaped iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and after our deliuerance from lesser afflictions, haue (as our Sauiour speaketh) some worser punishment inflicted vpon vs. And withall, let vs labour in the contrary workes of<note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 14.</note> holynesse and righteousnesse, endeauouring by our abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant fruits of an holy &amp; sanctified life, that our heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 8.</note> may be glorified; &amp; so may we be assured that the Lord will for the time to come, either preserue vs out of such af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, as we haue formerly suffered, or will inflict them onely for our triall, and the manifestation of his gifts and graces in vs; bringing vs as his most approued souldiars into this conflict of tentations, that we may obtaine victory ouer all our spirituall enemies, and afterwards be crowned with all glory and happinesse in his heauenly kingdome, which he grant vnto vs that hath dearly bought it for vs, Iesus Christ the righteous, to whom with the Father, and the holy Spirit, be rendered of vs, and his whole Church, al honour and praise, power, maiestie and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion both now and for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.
